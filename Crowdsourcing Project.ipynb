My ALT and AST levels went back to normal levels and my LDL and total cholesterol decreased to very acceptable levels. I have had no negative reaction to Praluent. One plus is that a couple months after I stopped taking Crestor I noticed that my mental processes seemed to be sharper. I've had good results from taking Praluent. My body seems to handle it very well and my mental processes haven't degraded to infant levels yet. Your mileage may vary. Sometimes we have to try one or two different drugs for a particular ailment to find the one that our body can handle. How your body will tolerate a PCSK9 inhibitor is something you won't find out until you start taking it. I think they've had good results overall and I've certainly benefited from taking Praluent but we're all different so your response to it is something you'll want to be sensitive to. Statin drugs are dirt cheap. Praluent isn't cheap and won't come off patent for quite a few years. Nominal price is around $550 a month. Hopefully your insurance will cover all or most of this. It comes in a syringe that you inject every 15 days. It comes in a pen that you press against your skin in a fatty location and push a button. The pen pokes the needle into your skin and injects the fluid. Takes maybe 3-4 seconds. Super easy if you don't have an irrational fear of needles and that sort of thing.\"\n",
