HIV-1\\'s main receptor is CD4 and its coreceptor is CCR5, not \"K 4\".\\n\\n2) HIV-1 does not \"sneak into your cell\". It fuses its membrane with the host cell membrane after binding to its receptor AND coreceptor, and then proceeds to invade the host cell (which can AND is detected by the host cells) and integrate its DNA into the host\\'s DNA in a pretty complex manner.\\n\\n3) Yes, there were two people (not one) cured from HIV-1 infection, and both of them were cured in a similar fashion: via complete irradiation of their immune system followed by a bone marrow transplantation with a very specific **homozygous** mutation on the HIV-1 coreceptor, a mutation that we called CCR5delta32, and that renders the protein non-functional. The homozygous part is important: a heterozygous CCR5delta32 won\\'t render the patient immune to HIV-1.\\n\\nHovever, no way we can sell it as a cure for a bunch of reasons. First of all, an irradiation and a bone marrow transplantation is a stupidly agressive treatment that\\'s used on a last resort for cancer treatment and other autoimmune diseases. It has a 60% chance of survival during the first year due to many complications. In medical ethics (both in clinical and in research) there\\'s what we call the no maleficence, or \"*primum no nocere*\" (\"first, do not harm\") rule: we cannot willing submit a patient to dangerous or life-risk treatments if there are other treatments available. And if none\\'s available, it\\'s better to do nothing.\\n\\nSecondly, you have to find a donor that\\'s compatible with you (chances get much lower if said person isn\\'t from your immediate family) AND that has the **homozygous** delta32 mutation (which\\'s exceedingly rare in itself).\\n\\nI know that this will come up, so I will just say it here. No, we cannot just use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a delta32 and proceed to the bone marrow transplantation. We\\'re now only noticing that CRISPR isn\\'t as precise as we thought, and it can generate lots of off-site mutations and even DNA damage. No way we can gamble on that technology for *in vivo* treatment, not unless we understand better how to control it (*in vitro* is fine). This of course also goes along the no maleficence rule.

HIV-1\\'s main receptor is CD4 and its coreceptor is CCR5, not \"K 4\".\\n\\n2) HIV-1 does not \"sneak into your cell\". It fuses its membrane with the host cell membrane after binding to its receptor AND coreceptor, and then proceeds to invade the host cell (which can AND is detected by the host cells) and integrate its DNA into the host\\'s DNA in a pretty complex manner.\\n\\n3) Yes, there were two people (not one) cured from HIV-1 infection, and both of them were cured in a similar fashion: via complete irradiation of their immune system followed by a bone marrow transplantation with a very specific **homozygous** mutation on the HIV-1 coreceptor, a mutation that we called CCR5delta32, and that renders the protein non-functional. The homozygous part is important: a heterozygous CCR5delta32 won\\'t render the patient immune to HIV-1.\\n\\nHovever, no way we can sell it as a cure for a bunch of reasons. First of all, an irradiation and a bone marrow transplantation is a stupidly agressive treatment that\\'s used on a last resort for cancer treatment and other autoimmune diseases. It has a 60% chance of survival during the first year due to many complications. In medical ethics (both in clinical and in research) there\\'s what we call the no maleficence, or \"*primum no nocere*\" (\"first, do not harm\") rule: we cannot willing submit a patient to dangerous or life-risk treatments if there are other treatments available. And if none\\'s available, it\\'s better to do nothing.\\n\\nSecondly, you have to find a donor that\\'s compatible with you (chances get much lower if said person isn\\'t from your immediate family) AND that has the **homozygous** delta32 mutation (which\\'s exceedingly rare in itself).\\n\\nI know that this will come up, so I will just say it here. No, we cannot just use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a delta32 and proceed to the bone marrow transplantation. We\\'re now only noticing that CRISPR isn\\'t as precise as we thought, and it can generate lots of off-site mutations and even DNA damage. No way we can gamble on that technology for *in vivo* treatment, not unless we understand better how to control it (*in vitro* is fine). This of course also goes along the no maleficence rule.

By the way, I\\'m a Immunology Masters student, whose research project is about HIV-1 infection and immunology, if that\\'s worth something.\\n\\n1) There\\'s no such thing as a \"cell door\", it\\'s a viral receptor and/or coreceptor. HIV-1\\'s main receptor is CD4 and its coreceptor is CCR5, not \"K 4\".\\n\\n2) HIV-1 does not \"sneak into your cell\". It fuses its membrane with the host cell membrane after binding to its receptor AND coreceptor, and then proceeds to invade the host cell (which can AND is detected by the host cells) and integrate its DNA into the host\\'s DNA in a pretty complex manner.\\n\\n3) Yes, there were two people (not one) cured from HIV-1 infection, and both of them were cured in a similar fashion: via complete irradiation of their immune system followed by a bone marrow transplantation with a very specific **homozygous** mutation on the HIV-1 coreceptor, a mutation that we called CCR5delta32, and that renders the protein non-functional. The homozygous part is important: a heterozygous CCR5delta32 won\\'t render the patient immune to HIV-1.\\n\\nHovever, no way we can sell it as a cure for a bunch of reasons. First of all, an irradiation and a bone marrow transplantation is a stupidly agressive treatment that\\'s used on a last resort for cancer treatment and other autoimmune diseases. It has a 60% chance of survival during the first year due to many complications. In medical ethics (both in clinical and in research) there\\'s what we call the no maleficence, or \"*primum no nocere*\" (\"first, do not harm\") rule: we cannot willing submit a patient to dangerous or life-risk treatments if there are other treatments available. And if none\\'s available, it\\'s better to do nothing.\\n\\nSecondly, you have to find a donor that\\'s compatible with you (chances get much lower if said person isn\\'t from your immediate family) AND that has the **homozygous** delta32 mutation (which\\'s exceedingly rare in itself).\\n\\nI know that this will come up, so I will just say it here. No, we cannot just use CRISPR-Cas9 to generate a delta32 and proceed to the bone marrow transplantation. We\\'re now only noticing that CRISPR isn\\'t as precise as we thought, and it can generate lots of off-site mutations and even DNA damage. No way we can gamble on that technology for *in vivo* treatment, not unless we understand better how to control it (*in vitro* is fine). This of course also goes along the no maleficence rule. Since we don\\'t have the whole scope of the problems that CRISPR can generate, we won\\'t be using it.', 'author': 'matheusaran', 'score': 13, 'date': '2020-08-12'}, {'type': 'reply', 'id': 'g19mf8p', 'name': 't1_g19mf8p', 'parent_id': 't1_g19dkcz', 'link_id': 't3_i8ehn7', 'text': \"The treatment you're talking about was done to cancer patients as a last ditch effort, who happened to also be HIV positive.

Physiologically, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) attenuates LDLR function by binding to the LDLR extracellular domain, leading to its lysosomal degradation and thereby preventing the total depletion of circulating LDL-C. However, pathogenic variants of PCSK9 are able to reduce the availability of LDLR, thus significantly increasing plasma LDL-C levels. Despite this understanding, the detailed molecular mechanism of LDLR-PCSK9 interaction remains elusive due to the lack of a full atomistic structure of LDLR. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to predict LDLR structural dynamics upon binding to PCSK9. Furthermore, two PCSK9 variants, E498A and R499G that were identified in clinically diagnosed Malaysian FH patients were investigated for their mutational effects. The simulations, spanning 500 ns, were conducted for three LDLR-PCSK9 complexes: LDLR-PCSK9 wild-type (WT), LDLR-PCSK9 (E498A), and LDLR-PCSK9 (R499G). Throughout the simulations, PCSK9 structure remained highly stable, in contrast to the LDLR structure that sampled large conformational space. The WT complex exhibited the least change, whereas the R499G complex displayed the most pronounced conformational rearrangement. During the simulations of WT and E498A complexes, the beta-propeller domain of LDLR formed interactions with the prodomain of PCSK9. Aligned with the observation, the MM/GBSA analysis revealed that the E498A complex exhibited the highest LDLR-PCSK9 binding affinity (-63.81 kcal/mol), followed by the WT complex (-33.07 kcal/mol), and the R499G complex (-24.21 kcal/mol). These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between LDLR and PCSK9, highlighting the importance of structural flexibility in mediating their functional relationship.

The simulations, spanning 500 ns, were conducted for three LDLR-PCSK9 complexes: LDLR-PCSK9 wild-type (WT), LDLR-PCSK9 (E498A), and LDLR-PCSK9 (R499G). Throughout the simulations, PCSK9 structure remained highly stable, in contrast to the LDLR structure that sampled large conformational space. The WT complex exhibited the least change, whereas the R499G complex displayed the most pronounced conformational rearrangement. During the simulations of WT and E498A complexes, the beta-propeller domain of LDLR formed interactions with the prodomain of PCSK9. Aligned with the observation, the MM/GBSA analysis revealed that the E498A complex exhibited the highest LDLR-PCSK9 binding affinity (-63.81 kcal/mol), followed by the WT complex (-33.07 kcal/mol), and the R499G complex (-24.21 kcal/mol). These findings provide novel insights into the dynamic interactions between LDLR and PCSK9, highlighting the importance of structural flexibility in mediating their functional relationship. Further studies with complete LDLR structures are required to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying LDLR-PCSK9-mediated cholesterol homeostasis.', 'author': 'basmwklz', 'score': 1, 'date': '2024-07-27', 'replies': []}, {'type': 'post', 'id': '1dptqy3', 'author': 'chaoserrant', 'text': 'I am surprised by the case of my old aunt with very high familial cholesterol.

I do not have FH but have high LDL and low HDL due to the steroids. Unfortunately my libido is very low and I have poor erectile quality and lethargy without it every time I have tried to lower the dosage so I really think I need it for my life quality. My father took statins in his old age but he tolerated them very poorly and had many side effects - like myalgia - so I doubt I would be able to take them. Sometimes I get angina in my chest, which worries me, but just I can't go through life as a young man with a dead member and no energy or libido.\\n\\nI've even thought about paying out of pocket for a PCSK9 inhibitor despite the absurd cost, but it makes me wonder why they're so hard to get. They seem to crush LDL with very few side effects compared to statins. Why are they only approved by the FDA for FH, unstable angina, and CAD? Is there any plan to make them more available to the general public who suffer from high cholesterol as possibly even a prophylactic? Do the drug companies even want them to be approved more generally by the FDA?\\n\\nI don't understand why they haven't been approved and covered by insurance more broadly?

Thankfully, drugs already exist that inhibit PCSK9 mainly to control cholesterol. Recent small scale studies confirm  inhibiting PCSK9 lowers urine protein by a ton, and it should be relatively quick(in medical terms) to trial this on CKD patients.\\n\\nIf your doctors have prescribed you PCSK9 inhibitors to control your cholesterol, or consume food like berberine that naturally inhibit PCSK9, you may be inadvertently helping your kidneys as well. There are numerous papers and clinical trials that tried to understand how some natural  PCSK9 inhibitors helped reduce urine protein, but this is the first one that potentially found the mechanism of how it really works.\\n\\n\\n> an illuminating study from Aarhus University has shed light on a surprising connection between a protein commonly associated with treating cardiovascular diseases and a crucial kidney function, potentially laying the groundwork for innovative therapeutic strategies.\\n\\n> \"Our research shows that PCSK9 influences a kidney receptor responsible for protein reabsorption, a critical factor in maintaining balanced protein levels in urine. This could potentially provide a new treatment approach for patients suffering from kidney overload and subsequent proteinuria,\" \\n\\n> This \\'megalin receptor,\\' as it is called, holds the key to the kidney\\'s capacity to reabsorb filtered proteins, thus influencing the amount of protein found in urine. A malfunctioning megalin receptor can overload the system, causing proteinuria—an excess of protein in the urine—which is not only a significant symptom of kidney disease but also a serious risk factor for chronic kidney disease development. In this scenario, the megalin receptor\\'s functionality is negatively regulated by PCSK9.\\n\\n> Weyer and her research team are enthusiastic about pursuing the potential of PCSK9 inhibitors as a novel treatment approach for kidney diseases. **Their findings could pave the way for groundbreaking therapeutic options that may significantly improve the lives of those living with chronic kidney disease.**\\n\\n> \"We\\'re laying the groundwork for future investigations into the therapeutic effects of PCSK9 inhibition on kidney diseases,\" Weyer shared. **\"If the benefits are proven, it won\\'t be long before we can offer a revolutionary new treatment method to kidney patients.\"** \\n\\nArticles:\\n\\n* https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/995015\\n* https://www.thebrighterside.news/post/groundbreaking-new-treatment-options-for-chronic-kidney-diseases\\n* https://www.genengnews.com/topics/protein-that-helps-treat-cardiovascular-disease-may-also-aid-in-kidney-disease/\\n\\nFull peer reviewed medical paper here: https://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538(23)00481-7/fulltext\\n\\nSmall scale trial 1 that shows reduction in urine protein after PCSK9 inhibition: https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/35/Supplement_3/gfaa142.P0183/5853517\\n\\nSmall scale trial 2 that shows reduction in urine protein after PCSK9 inhibition: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8618891/', 'subreddit': 'kidneydisease', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2wkhb', 'score': 24, 'upvotes': 24, 'num_comments': 16, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/kidneydisease/comments/14xogk6/potentially_great_news_last_week_a_top_eu/', 'date': '2023-07-12', 'comments': [{'id': 'jro1m5f', 'name': 't1_jro1m5f', 'parent_id': 't3_14xogk6', 'link_id': 't3_14xogk6', 'text': \"Thank you for sharing this.

You must have watched some shitty biased videos if that is really your conclusion. Go watch some videos that do not spread the cholesterol hypothesis, and instead share something better like the response to injury theory.\\n\\n\\n> the plaque literally starts as young as 10 years old and continues\\n\\nUtter nonsense. Fatty streaks are different from, and not precursors of atherosclerotic plaques. This myth that fatty streaks lead to atherosclerosis is alarmist nonsense, coming from those that profit off the hysteria, or those that did not properly research the disease. https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/19bzo1j/fatty_streaks_are_not_precursors_of/\\n\\n\\n> Ldl of 55 or less is the number if you never want to worry about heart attack.\\n\\nAgain nonsense. Heart disease is response to injury like all chronic diseases, it is a consequence of your artery wall cells being damaged one way or another. Even with hypothetical zero LDL levels, you still get heart disease from smoking, pollution, diabetes, and trans fats. The presentation might be slightly different, but you would still die nonetheless from the damaged arteries. Here is an example thread where this topic was discussed to death: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1eindnr/risk_factors_leading_to_a_heart_attack/\\n\\n\\n> no diet or lifestyle is ever gonna sustain that number \\n\\nThat should have been a dead giveaway that something ain't clapping. Plenty of people avoid heart disease even without fairyland levels of LDL.\\n\\n\\n> unless you are one of the lucky bastards with genetic mutation such as PCSK9 or FHBL who no matter what they eat have low levels of ldl.\\n\\nThose mutations have serious side effects, they are not that lucky as you claim. And again they can still easily get heart disease from the aforementioned risk factors. LDL is not necessary at all for you to wreck your arteries.\\n\\n\\n> There is no other way around it i mean how long can you keep up a life with 40g fiber 10g sat fat the rest of your life?\\n\\nYou do not need to, virtually every healthy diet causes atherosclerosis regression, even low carbohydrate diets that have a tendency to elevate LDL (because of higher lipolysis and VLDL stability).\\n\\nShai, I., Spence, J.

Remember that FH can involve dysfunctional LDL receptors, so it does not matter if statins or PCSK9 inhibitors upregulate them. LDL-R mutant cells still can not take up cholesterol and fatty acids from LDL to repair their membranes.\\n\\n\\n> There are also drugs in trial ongoing to bring down lp (a)\\n\\nLP(a) is even less causal in heart disease than LDL, it does not contribute to the development of the underlying plaque, it only increases clotting on existing plaques.

Background: LDL cholesterol is a well established risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. How much one should or safely can lower this risk factor remains debated. We aimed to explore the relationship between progressively lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations achieved at 4 weeks and clinical efficacy and safety in the FOURIER trial of evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9).\\n\\nMethods: In this prespecified secondary analysis of 25 982 patients from the randomised FOURIER trial, the relationship between achieved LDL-cholesterol concentration at 4 weeks and subsequent cardiovascular outcomes (primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularisation, or unstable angina; key secondary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) and ten prespecified safety events of interest was examined over a median of 2·2 years of follow-up. We used multivariable modelling to adjust for baseline factors associated with achieved LDL cholesterol. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01764633.\\n\\nFindings: Between Feb 8, 2013, and June 5, 2015, 27 564 patients were randomly assigned a treatment in the FOURIER study. 1025 (4%) patients did not have an LDL cholesterol measured at 4 weeks and 557 (2%) had already had a primary endpoint event or one of the ten prespecified safety events before the week-4 visit. From the remaining 25 982 patients (94% of those randomly assigned) 13 013 were assigned evolocumab and 12 969 were assigned placebo. 2669 (10%) of 25 982 patients achieved LDL-cholesterol concentrations of less than 0·5 mmol/L, 8003 (31%) patients achieved concentrations between 0·5 and less than 1·3 mmol/L, 3444 (13%) patients achieved concentrations between 1·3 and less than 1·8 mmol/L, 7471 (29%) patients achieved concentrations between 1·8 to less than 2·6 mmol/L, and 4395 (17%) patients achieved concentrations of 2·6 mmol/L or higher. There was a highly significant monotonic relationship between low LDL-cholesterol concentrations and lower risk of the primary and secondary efficacy composite endpoints extending to the bottom first percentile (LDL-cholesterol concentrations of less than 0·2 mmol/L; p=0·0012 for the primary endpoint, p=0·0001 for the secondary endpoint). Conversely, no significant association was observed between achieved LDL cholesterol and safety outcomes, either for all serious adverse events or any of the other nine prespecified safety events.\\n\\nInterpretation: **There was a monotonic relationship between achieved LDL cholesterol and major cardiovascular outcomes down to LDL-cholesterol concentrations of less than 0·2 mmol/L. Conversely, there were no safety concerns with very low LDL-cholesterol concentrations over a median of 2·2 years. These data support further LDL-cholesterol lowering in patients with cardiovascular disease to well below current recommendations.**”\\n\\nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28859947/', 'subreddit': 'ScientificNutrition', 'subreddit_id': 't5_qgptn', 'score': 3, 'upvotes': 10, 'num_comments': 22, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/mho59z/clinical_efficacy_and_safety_of_achieving_very/', 'date': '2021-04-01', 'comments': [{'id': 'gszysin', 'name': 't1_gszysin', 'parent_id': 't3_mho59z', 'link_id': 't3_mho59z', 'text': 'Welcome to /r/ScientificNutrition.

I would encourage you to revisit this reasoning.\\n\\n[Check out the dose response curve of various statins](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Hartman-5/publication/7416016/figure/fig1/AS:601595016409093@1520442837311/Dose-response-relationship-for-monotherapy-with-statins-The-symbols-and-bars-represent.png) pick a good one, likely either rosuvastatin or pravastatin, both of which have a low side-effect profile.  Monitor for side effects and if none, enjoy a nice long ASCVD free life.  \"Downstream nutrient depletion\" is not a cause for concern.  The primary cause for concern is chronic muscle pain, which occurs in a small, but significant population of folks that get on statins.  Also, it\\'s worth noting that all the trials for statins were for folks with well-developed ASCVD and as such the dosage recommendations are probably much higher than they need to be.  Getting the maximal efficacy at the lowest dose will yield the lowest potential side-effect burden.\\n\\nBeyond that, consider ezetimibe and bempedoic acid, both of which work in complementary ways to statins and will further help lower LDL and more importantly ApoB.  Ezetimibe has been around for quite some time, is cheap, and is very well tolerated.  The MOA for bempedoic acid is well understood and there\\'s quite some data showing improved biomarkers.  However, in May of 2023 a study was published showing significant reduction in negative outcomes (i.e. MI events) with bempedoic acid.\\n\\nMetformin would be off-label and prohibitively expensive.  A PCSK9 inhibitor would likely also be difficult to get insurance to cover and otherwise prohibitively expensive.  Typically it\\'s only covered for secondary intervention, i.e those that have already had an MI.  For my insurance, it\\'s only covered in the event that I\\'ve proven I cannot tolerate the maximum dose of a statin.\\n\\nMy current regime is rosuvastatin 10mg plus ezetimibe 10mg QD.  I\\'ve recently added bempedoic acid (a combo with exetimibe called \"Nexlizet\"), no prior auth was required by my insurance.

Here is a very specific medical condition and the the primary intervention the entire medical community has settled upon to treat this condition you\\'ve opted out of because of dubious reasoning?  I would encourage you to revisit this reasoning.\\n\\n[Check out the dose response curve of various statins](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Daniel-Hartman-5/publication/7416016/figure/fig1/AS:601595016409093@1520442837311/Dose-response-relationship-for-monotherapy-with-statins-The-symbols-and-bars-represent.png) pick a good one, likely either rosuvastatin or pravastatin, both of which have a low side-effect profile.  Monitor for side effects and if none, enjoy a nice long ASCVD free life.  \"Downstream nutrient depletion\" is not a cause for concern.  The primary cause for concern is chronic muscle pain, which occurs in a small, but significant population of folks that get on statins.  Also, it\\'s worth noting that all the trials for statins were for folks with well-developed ASCVD and as such the dosage recommendations are probably much higher than they need to be.  Getting the maximal efficacy at the lowest dose will yield the lowest potential side-effect burden.\\n\\nBeyond that, consider ezetimibe and bempedoic acid, both of which work in complementary ways to statins and will further help lower LDL and more importantly ApoB.  Ezetimibe has been around for quite some time, is cheap, and is very well tolerated.  The MOA for bempedoic acid is well understood and there\\'s quite some data showing improved biomarkers.  However, in May of 2023 a study was published showing significant reduction in negative outcomes (i.e. MI events) with bempedoic acid.\\n\\nMetformin would be off-label and prohibitively expensive.  A PCSK9 inhibitor would likely also be difficult to get insurance to cover and otherwise prohibitively expensive.  Typically it\\'s only covered for secondary intervention, i.e those that have already had an MI.  For my insurance, it\\'s only covered in the event that I\\'ve proven I cannot tolerate the maximum dose of a statin.\\n\\nMy current regime is rosuvastatin 10mg plus ezetimibe 10mg QD.  I\\'ve recently added bempedoic acid (a combo with exetimibe called \"Nexlizet\"), no prior auth was required by my insurance.  I\\'ve tried a host of supplements and dietary modifications and nothing move the needle more than the statin.\\n\\nCurrently my ApoB is around 5th percentile for my age.  When I started this process it was 85th.  Do get an NMR lipid panel and measure Lp(a) as well as ApoB.

I do watch my saturated fat but I get about 7 to 8% of calories from saturated fat.  My LDL is 27 so I don't think my saturated fat intake is a problem.\\n\\nAlso, there is no reason to limit carbs at all.  It is a good idea to limit *refined* carbs but even that need not be zero.  The AHA recommends that added sugar not exceed 6% of calories which seems reasonable to me.  Carbs in the form of soluble fiber will help reduce LDL.  Most other carbs don't really have a major effect on LDL either.\", 'author': 'Koshkaboo', 'score': 3, 'date': '2024-09-13'}, {'type': 'reply', 'id': 'ln07lrq', 'name': 't1_ln07lrq', 'parent_id': 't1_lmzt23v', 'link_id': 't3_1fg48uu', 'text': 'How are you going to lower lp(a)?', 'author': 'AppropriateCat4975', 'score': 2, 'date': '2024-09-13'}, {'type': 'comment', 'id': 'lmzj157', 'name': 't1_lmzj157', 'parent_id': 't3_1fg48uu', 'link_id': 't3_1fg48uu', 'text': 'A much better test to get done is a CCTA.

I do not think I will be in the 5's but I'm hoping for 6's at least. \\nI am hesitant to stop medication. I am on 500mg x 2 metformin and took ozempic for 2 months. I was not scared to stop the ozempic and I've been completely fine without it. I really feel the side effects were more harmful than helpful. I'm going to discuss with my Dr. cutting metformin in half. If they advise against it I'm finding a new Dr. All Dr.'s know that it is healthier to change your lifestyle naturally and should be so proud of your hard work. Major red flag.

But there are always exceptions for data that could make or break a company, piquing the interest of potential investors and partners alike.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nData, for instance, like what Sekar Kathiresan is bringing to the virtual conference, showing that a one-time treatment with Verve Therapeutics’ base editor can keep PCSK9 levels low — thereby lowering LDL cholesterol, aka the bad kind — out to 6 months. In non-human primates.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe two takeaway figures are 61% LDL cholesterol reduction and 89% cut in average blood PCSK9 protein level. That’s the same level of reduction for PCSK9 as the treatment registered at 2 weeks, when the researchers documented a 59% drop in LDL-C.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“What you are seeing is durable lowering of cholesterol and consistent lowering of LDL cholesterol 6 months after administration of the gene editing treatment,” Kathiresan told Endpoints News in a preview.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhile preclinical, the results mark a significant step for the in vivo use of the next-generation gene editing tool known as base editing. Whereas the first generation of CRISPR gene editing molecules would snip the DNA sequence and let it repair on its own, base editing works by converting one letter on the genome to another.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn this case the construct, VERVE-101, made a single change from A to G in the genetic sequence of the PCSK9 gene in the liver, with an aim to inactivate the gene for good.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs liver cells turn over roughly every 200 days, Kathiresan added, 6-month durability data offer reasonable confidence that the changes are there to stay.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“The fundamental problem with coronary heart disease is cumulative exposure to LDL over time, OK? And the fundamental treatment is to lower that cumulative exposure as much as possible,” said the CEO, who left behind an academic career and a directorship at Mass General’s Center for Genomic Medicine to steer the biotech. “The way to think about this is kind of the area under the curve analysis, you know? You want to keep the LDL down and consistently down for as long a period as possible.”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nVERVE-101 rides on the pharmacologic validation offered by monoclonal antibodies and siRNA therapies that target PCSK9 but does away with the need for chronic treatment. Each of which he sees presenting its own compliance issues that could lead to insufficient protection.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWith toxicology studies underway, Verve expects to dose its first patient some time in 2022. By targeting the initial clinical indication of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, the company will be developing “a genetic treatment for a genetic disease” before turning to “garden variety coronary heart disease.”\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nPCSK9 will just be a start. Kathiresan has identified seven other genes that, as he’s discovered over years of studies in population genetics, harbor protective mutations — one of them being ANGPTL3, for which Verve has also presented 2-week preclinical data. All eight targets fall into one of three pathways: LDL-C, triglycerides or lipoprotein(a).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n“Each of those pathways are kind of complementary in terms of risk for a patient,” he said. “So a medicine targeting each of those pathways should be additive in terms of benefit.”', 'subreddit': 'ketoscience', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2v172', 'score': 2, 'upvotes': 2, 'num_comments': 1, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ketoscience/comments/kvvutx/looking_to_leapfrog_antibodies_and_rnai_sekar/', 'date': '2021-01-12', 'comments': [{'id': 'gj0sn75', 'name': 't1_gj0sn75', 'parent_id': 't3_kvvutx', 'link_id': 't3_kvvutx', 'text': \"PCSK9 knockout mice get fatter subcutaneous.

Going even further, this has led to a growing questioning of the robustness of the well-established cholesterol-heart theory, stating that high cholesterol levels ineluctably and strongly increase the risk of coronary artery obstruction and acute myocardial infarction. In the same way, many scientists no longer agree with the theory that high cholesterol increases the risk of ischemic stroke. To test the cholesterol-heart theory, the present systematic review aimed at examining whether the most recent clinical trials testing powerful cholesterol-lowering interventions (such as anti-CETP and anti-PCSK9) report effective reduction of fatal cardiovascular complications and improved survival. Because of high heterogeneity between studies, a meta-analysis was not feasible. The review did show that neither anti-CETP nor anti-PCSK9 treatment can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular death, thereby giving credit to the questioning of the cholesterol-heart theory. Our review also shows that the quality of the included trials is generally poor with suspicion of inefficient blinding. This undermines the validity of the reported nonfatal events and thereby increases the importance of comparing fatal endpoints in both groups to test the cholesterol-heart theory.\\xa0\\n\\n**TL:DR : If cholesterol-lowering treatments other than statins reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, it would confirm that the cholesterol-heart theory is correct. However, if these substances fail to reduce the risk, the cholesterol-heart theory should be rejected.**\\n\\n**Conclusion** \\n\\nThe aim of this study was to examine the effects of cholesterol-lowering by agents other than statins on clinical events. The review we conducted shows that despite a very significant effect on cholesterol levels, the CETP and PCSK9 inhibitors have not been shown to diminish the frequency of clinical events in high-risk patients, especially not the important ones represented by total and cardiovascular deaths. The only way to confirm or infirm this would be to have access to raw data, especially in view of the suspicion of insufficient blinding. Another consequence of these findings is that they speak strongly against the cholesterol-heart theory, confirming the doubts that have already been raised by a large group of scientists all over the world. As this theory leads to millions of people taking statin drugs, it appears highly necessary that access to raw data of all statin trials be allowed so as to reappreciate them. This is an important aspect considering the very strong conflicts of interest that the majority of scientists present, all the more concerning as many of these scientists exercise official activities in Association boards and guidelines committees and in medical journals.

Since joining about a week ago, I have scoured posts about low saturated fat diets, Peter Attia (sp?), Lilly clinical trials, etc. I spoke with my doctor about the following questions and was met with a very haulted response in that I don\\'t pose a threat right now. Basically, the phone conversation I had with her left me with feeling like I\\'m overreacting because I am only 37 and not \"currently\" at risk. I mentioned to her that I have a young child and my mother died young (64,  pancreatic cancer) and I am trying to be as proactive (as Kaiser markets themselves and prides themselves as being) as possible. She couldn\\'t get off the phone with me fast enough and was pretty combative with my research based responses, basically saying it without saying it that she was the doctor and this is what they know now. Any advice on the following (doctor\\'s response in parenthesis) is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.\\n\\n  \\nStats: 37 year old female, 5\\'2\", 158 lbs, Teacher (active, but not ACTIVE)\\n\\nHere goes:\\n\\n  \\n1. Based on my most recent blood test, my cholesterol went from in September 154 to 191 (normal value is <199), my triglycerides went from 76 to 87 (normal value is <149), my HDL went from 48 to 58 (normal value is > 40), my LDL went from 91 to 117 (normal value is <99), my Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein went from 3.3 to 3.2 (normal value is <3.9; so relatively the same), and my cholesterol (non-HDL) went from 106 to 133 (nonHDL targets are 30 mg higher than LDL targets; what does that mean)? Can you determine what happened?\\xa0(She didn\\'t seem to be concerned with this \"spike\" and didn\\'t know what caused it. Thoughts on the above numbers? I did have my thyroid tested test came back normal, so no caused for concern about hypothyroidism)\\n\\n2. I have been pretty diligent with my 10 mg statin and have been religious with my statin since my lipid panel on 6/22. Would you recommend upping my statin or just retesting in a few months? Are there negative reasons for raising a statin? (She doesn\\'t want to raise my statin at this time, because there can be negative risk factors with upping a statin. She said that 10mg is the \"highest\" for low to moderate risk patients, and because there is no family risk, she wanted to stay put at 10mg).\\n\\n3. I am interested in possibly taking Ezetimibe with my statin as combination therapy or a PCSK9 inhibitor like Repatha. Do you recommend any low dose aspirin? (She ordered a lipid panel for October, three months from now, and said she would prescribe me Zetia if I wanted to move forward with that at that time; Thoughts?)\\n\\n4. When is the best time to take my statin\\xa0for maximum absorption? (She mentioned that since I take Crestor, taking it right before bed is best. She said that taking it with a CoQ10 doesn\\'t mess up absorption, but that I should take CoQ10 before a meal and then my statin before bed and I will be fine).\\n\\n5. I am very concerned with my Lipoprotein A results. I know that the normal value is <75 and I was shocked to see that my value is 301. From what I understand, this is a result of genetic high cholesterol and from what I understand, there is currently no medication to lower lipoprotein a levels, but that you need to maintain a low LDL and basically take care of everything else to minimize your risk of strokes, heart attacks, etc. (This is where she got pretty combatative with me and frustrated and explained that is why this test is not normally done because the information just basically becomes an FYI witht much to do with it. I explained to her that I\\'m an information person and basically having a baseline is helpful to me so that I can do everything in my power to control other factors, since I can\\'t do much about this number. She agreed and said that there are many things in the works right now in terms of how to treat LPa (like what is going on with Lilly and that they just don\\'t know how to move forward right now). This is where she got pretty combatative with information and \"being in the know\" such as a doctor and that she realizes that this information isn\\'t readily available to people outside of the medical field, so she forwarded me this information in regards to LPa levels:\\n\\n  \\nThere is limited evidence indicating that Lp(a) lowering reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (see \\'Disease associations\\' above). Thus, except in very rare cases, we do not target Lp(a) with any therapy known to lower Lp(a). (See \\'Next steps\\' below.)\\xa0Initial approach — Our initial approach to reducing ASCVD risk in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to its target. (See \"Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease\" and \"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease\".)\\xa0Usually this involves treatment with a statin, with or without ezetimibe. Statins increase Lp(a) levels \\\\[58\\\\]. However, the impact of this increase on cardiovascular events is not known and is felt to be small \\\\[42,59\\\\]. Ezetimibe does not lower Lp(a).\\xa0Some patients who cannot achieve an optimal LDL-C with statin plus ezetimibe are treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor. In the FOURIER trial, Lp(a) reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was associated with ASCVD risk reduction independent of LDL-C lowering, as discussed below \\\\[41\\\\]. Thus, very high-risk patients with high Lp(a) levels may benefit disproportionately from a lipid-lowering strategy that includes a PCSK9 inhibitor. In a post-hoc analysis of ODYSSEY outcomes, participants with LDL-C levels between 55 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL with a Lp(a) level above the median of 13.6 mg/dL had fewer cardiovascular disease events on treatment with alirocumab \\\\[60\\\\].\\xa0Next steps — For patients with elevated Lp(a) who have reached their LDL-C target or who have received all recommended therapies to lower LDL-C, we await definitive evidence from ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials with selective Lp(a)-lowering therapies and do not have any broader recommendations on Lp(a) lowering.\\xa0The use of these therapies in this setting has not been proven in prospectively designed clinical outcome trials. In addition, there are costs to these therapies.\\n\\n6. Do statins raise lipoprotein a levels?\\xa0(She said she didn\\'t know; that there are mixed results in this, but basically I am not a candidate who truly \"can\\'t\" take a statin, so the benefits outweight the costs)\\n\\n7. My goal is to get my LDL below 40 (need to go down 77 points) and keep my HDL above 45. I would like to test my ApoB (that should be in the 40s). How long would it take to get my LDL down to 40-what extreme measures do I need to do?\\xa0(She said that it\\'s possible to get my LDL down as close to 40, but that it is really hard to do and would account for a \"pretty miserable life\" and that she \"wasn\\'t sure how I would feel with an LDL that low\" since our body needs some cholesterol to function. She said that testing for ApoB is mute at this point (in the similar vein to testing for LPa) since it\\'s just FYI information and then what do I do with it if the range is out of normal, when the only current response is to treat with a statin, which I\\'m doing. She said that the \"extreme measure\" I could do at this time is to become plant based with my diet)\\n\\n8. I would like to meet with a cardiologist, and a lipidologist and endocrinologist, if possible. (She didn\\'t respond to the need to meet with a lipidologist or endocrinologist (I\\'m not sure if this is possible through Kaiser), but did put in a referral for a cardiologist, with obvious hesitation, as she thinks the referral will get bounced back. I mentioned that aren\\'t a risk patient due to my numbers, and was met with a similar response that because my risk is currently low, with an assumption that cardiologists are dealing with more severe cases and there isn\\'t much availability. She put in the referral and said that if it gets bounced back, that I would have to go through member services and make an appointment on my own, if it is okayed. \\\\*\\\\*This is where my major frustration is coming from. I don\\'t feel like my situation should be diluted solely based on the severity of what other people are going through. This is apples and oranges and I am trying to be proactive. I wil absolutely be following up with the cardiologist referral and next steps.\"\"\\n\\n9. I would like to schedule a CAC, an APoB test, and an APoA test. Would you recommend that I have a CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) or angiogram to see my plaque levels? I know it may show 0, but wouldn\\'t it be smart to have a baseline? (She said that the CAC is a test she can\\'t put a referral in for, but that the cardiologist would have to do that. She seemed to skate over ordering the APoB and APoa test, but I am sure her response will be that it is just \"more information\" that I just can do nothing about. I plan on asking my hopefully referred cardiologists about all of these tests)\\n\\n10. Should I be paying attention to Hs-CRP (inflammation), LP-PLA2 (enzyme to measure plaque activity), hba1c (blood sugar)?\\xa0(I didn\\'t ask her this question, but was wondering if any of you have any insight on monitoring any of these?)\\n\\n11. I\\'ve also heard that Niacin and/or CoQ10 can be helpful in lowering LDL (and possibly lipoprotein a). I\\'ve started taking 100 mgs of Coq10 and 3 tsps daily of Metamucil as a soluble fiber, since I know both of these things can help with lowering LDL. Should I continue CoQ10 & Metamucil? Would you also recommend taking Niacin and/or Fish Oil or any omegas? Keep with Metamucil or straight psyllium husk? Can psyllium husk affect the absorption of my statins? (She said that taking Niacin with me already being on a statin is not necessary nor recommended, due to the risks that niacin can cause. She said takign CoQ10 is smart since LDL can mess with the CoQ10 levels in our body and taking it as a supplement helps with that. She didn\\'t speak it to possibly lowering my LPa, though. She said taking Metamucil is great and that upping fiber in my diet is really smart. She said that Fish Oil has been pretty controversial and that it is actually showing some signs of being harmful (or not helpful) for people in my situation. She said that Metamucil of straight psyllium husk is fine and that psyllium husk does not affect the absoption of my statins)\\n\\n12. I\\'ve also read that a plant based diet is basically smart for someone in my situation. Would you recommend that I become a vegetarian, as well as avoiding cheese and eggs? Or just a low-carb diet? Should I be avoiding alcohol entirely? What is the recommended % of saturated fats that I should be staying under daily-less than 10mg?? Effects of coffee? Should I be intermittent fasting? I know that diet and exercise won\\'t affect the lipoprotein a, but it seems like I might need an extreme lifestyle change to really get my bad cholesterol levels as low as possible to help combat the lipoprotein a levels I can\\'t do much about. (She confirmed that if my goal is lower my rish of cardiovascular disease as much as possible, that switching to a plant-based diet and avoiding as much animal biproducts as possible is a must. She recommended avoiding cheed and eggs, but didn\\'t mention anything about going low carb. In terms of alcohol, she laughed in the fact that, \"Samantha! You\\'re 37 years old! You can have a drink  two a party and not worry about it!\" basically contributing to the notion that she \"said it without saying it\" that I am overreacting, and I really do not feel like I am. She confirmed that getting daily saturated fats down to 10mg a day is ideal, but really hard to do and that the best way to keep it as low as possible is with going plant based. She said that coffee is good for you and that it\\'s what we put in coffee that messes things up. I told her I have my coffee with stevia drops and oatmilk and she said that is fine. She said that intermittent fasting is controversial and that she would not recommend.)\\n\\n13. Are there any clinical trials available for people with my similar results? (She said that she is sure there are clinical trials but that she was unaware of them and it isn\\'t her wheelhouse or recommendation).\\n\\n  \\nWHEW! So, that is a summary sentence of the phone conversation. I am left with an action plan of: 1) another lipid panel in October 2024 2) keeping my statin at 10mg 3) going plant based in my diet 4) put in a refferal for a cardiologist. I feel like \"switching doctors\" within Kaiser will just provide me with another doctor in the network with the same response. Any other suggestions for me at this time?\\n\\nI\\'ve also been taking down some notes with the beneficial information from this feed.

You may not need to get your LDLC/Apo B that low and you are best off following sensible prevention strategies in terms of diet and lifestyle so that you don't have to go too aggressive on the medications. Plant-based is certainly an option should you want to pursue that because it eliminates any dietary cholesterol (in case you are an over-absorber), it minimizes sat fat as long as you aren't consuming coconut or palm oil, and it's very high in fiber. If you do go that route make sure to take a B12. BTW you can always order testing independently via [ownyourlabs.com](http://ownyourlabs.com) which uses LabCorp. (Update: or Precision Health Reports mentioned below). \\n\\n8. It's understandable you want to meet with these specialists but they are likely not going to be able to give you more insight than you've been able to gather already (and in about 1/100th of the amount of time as well so congrats there!). What is your A1C currently? Do you have T2D in the family? One thing you might do if you suspect fatty liver is request a liver US of your PCP which should be a no-brainer to order. Get a CAC scan too, while you are at it - 37 with high Lp(a) isn't too young for that. Another test you'll want to do over the next year or so is a carotid US esp. if the CAC comes back with a 0 score. \\n\\n9. Ah ok - yes you should go to the cardiologist for the CAC and carotid US too I guess. Or a CIMT if Kaiser has access to one. The other test that should be on your radar going forward is the ankle-brachia index. All three: CAC, CUS, and ABI are recommended by Dr. Bill Cromwell who is a top lipidologist and clinical researcher with a youtube presence via interview. He's also medical director at Precision Health Reports and they do a comprehensive cardiometabolic assessment for $249. I found them very useful as a supplement to the usual care I get from my own health system (not Kaiser but it also has its limits . . . ). Check them out if you want: [Precisionhealthreports.com](http://Precisionhealthreports.com)\\n\\n10. Yes. One advantage of the precision health reports resource is that they measure LP-IR and GlycA. I found both to be very helpful. Now you can order these via ownyourlabs too if you want. Both Precision and Ownyourlabs use LabCorp for the bloodwork. But Precision Health Reports has a wonderful user-friendly format where all the detailed testing is explained to me. Costs about an extra $100 for that but hey, I found it worth it. Precision Health reports also will test either Apo B or do the LDL particle count itself. I just did Apo B as it's basically just one number with the same info conveyed as a more complicated LDL particle count result.\\n\\n11. Dont' take Niacin. It's not been clinically shown to improve outcomes with high Lp(a) and the side effects including flushing, possible high LFT's and other stuff can be a problem. Psyllium husk is great, CoQ10 hasn't really been shown to be effective but many swear by it. Use it if you need to for muscle pain but other than that it might not be necessary.\\n\\n12. Best not to go LC. You are better off doing plant-based (IMO but that's backed by the research). The problem with LC is that it's usually accompanied by high fat (as in LC/HF or Keto). Keto can spike your LDLC/Apo B. Plant based will lower it. See Dr. Michael Greger's books or his website [Nutritionfacts.org](http://Nutritionfacts.org) if you need more info on going plant-based. As for alcohol, the latest research - in AHA's journal *Hypertension* -  is that even one drink per day can raise BP over the long term. I've had this discussion with my providers as well and some of them think I'm nuts lol. The reality is that there's simply no safe level of ethanol. Now, can one drink a week be harmful? Probably not. But every alcoholic beverage is a missed opportunity to drink something more healthy such as a cup of green tea. Your provider's advice re: coffee is accurate based on the research I've seen.\\n\\nWant to pause here for a minute: IMO you  have a decent PCP! She's obviously spending a lot of time answering your questions even if you both don't quite see eye-to-eye. \\n\\n13.  Interestingly, there were just published some results from the MESA trial re: aspirin use for those with high Lp(a) that suggested aspirin (probably low dose but not sure) can lower MACE 30-40%. Worth checking out. Don't have the link to the paper but Tom Dayspring mentioned it during an Lp(a) interview on Simon Hill's The Proof podcast. About one hour 37 min. in. I'd recommend listening to the entire ep. Also listen to Attia's interview of Benoit Arsenault (The Drive, probably in 2022?) as he is a top-notch Lp(a) researcher in Canada. Both these interviews will go into the weeds w/r/t that Lp(a) is exactly. I've spent the last few years listening and reading and am only beginning to understand it all myself. There's also a youtube with an expert panel from I think NYU on Lp(a) you can search for. They do an amazing job too. If I can re-find that I'll link here later on.\\n\\nRe: your dietary and lifestyle plan, you can consider Nu Salt or similar salt substitute, especially if you feel you are at risk of hypertension (or have been diagnosed). I use this due to family history with salt-sensitive hypertension. It's a nice hack. If you don't like the taste of potassium chloride you can always go 50/50 or 75/25 with the sodium and I believe there are brands that sell those combinations.\\n\\nBest of luck to you!\", 'author': 'meh312059', 'score': 6, 'date': '2024-07-07', 'replies': [{'id': 'lc3xavh', 'name': 't1_lc3xavh', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'Great post btw', 'author': 'Henry-2k', 'score': 3, 'date': '2024-07-07'}, {'id': 'lc43166', 'name': 't1_lc43166', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'I\\'d like to try the plant based diet (thank you for the Dr. Michale Greger book link!) prior to upping the statin and/or adding Zetia as combination therapy.

You may not need to get your LDLC/Apo B that low and you are best off following sensible prevention strategies in terms of diet and lifestyle so that you don't have to go too aggressive on the medications. Plant-based is certainly an option should you want to pursue that because it eliminates any dietary cholesterol (in case you are an over-absorber), it minimizes sat fat as long as you aren't consuming coconut or palm oil, and it's very high in fiber. If you do go that route make sure to take a B12. BTW you can always order testing independently via [ownyourlabs.com](http://ownyourlabs.com) which uses LabCorp. (Update: or Precision Health Reports mentioned below). \\n\\n8. It's understandable you want to meet with these specialists but they are likely not going to be able to give you more insight than you've been able to gather already (and in about 1/100th of the amount of time as well so congrats there!). What is your A1C currently? Do you have T2D in the family? One thing you might do if you suspect fatty liver is request a liver US of your PCP which should be a no-brainer to order. Get a CAC scan too, while you are at it - 37 with high Lp(a) isn't too young for that. Another test you'll want to do over the next year or so is a carotid US esp. if the CAC comes back with a 0 score. \\n\\n9. Ah ok - yes you should go to the cardiologist for the CAC and carotid US too I guess. Or a CIMT if Kaiser has access to one. The other test that should be on your radar going forward is the ankle-brachia index. All three: CAC, CUS, and ABI are recommended by Dr. Bill Cromwell who is a top lipidologist and clinical researcher with a youtube presence via interview. He's also medical director at Precision Health Reports and they do a comprehensive cardiometabolic assessment for $249. I found them very useful as a supplement to the usual care I get from my own health system (not Kaiser but it also has its limits . . . ). Check them out if you want: [Precisionhealthreports.com](http://Precisionhealthreports.com)\\n\\n10. Yes. One advantage of the precision health reports resource is that they measure LP-IR and GlycA. I found both to be very helpful. Now you can order these via ownyourlabs too if you want. Both Precision and Ownyourlabs use LabCorp for the bloodwork. But Precision Health Reports has a wonderful user-friendly format where all the detailed testing is explained to me. Costs about an extra $100 for that but hey, I found it worth it. Precision Health reports also will test either Apo B or do the LDL particle count itself. I just did Apo B as it's basically just one number with the same info conveyed as a more complicated LDL particle count result.\\n\\n11. Dont' take Niacin. It's not been clinically shown to improve outcomes with high Lp(a) and the side effects including flushing, possible high LFT's and other stuff can be a problem. Psyllium husk is great, CoQ10 hasn't really been shown to be effective but many swear by it. Use it if you need to for muscle pain but other than that it might not be necessary.\\n\\n12. Best not to go LC. You are better off doing plant-based (IMO but that's backed by the research). The problem with LC is that it's usually accompanied by high fat (as in LC/HF or Keto). Keto can spike your LDLC/Apo B. Plant based will lower it. See Dr. Michael Greger's books or his website [Nutritionfacts.org](http://Nutritionfacts.org) if you need more info on going plant-based. As for alcohol, the latest research - in AHA's journal *Hypertension* -  is that even one drink per day can raise BP over the long term. I've had this discussion with my providers as well and some of them think I'm nuts lol. The reality is that there's simply no safe level of ethanol. Now, can one drink a week be harmful? Probably not. But every alcoholic beverage is a missed opportunity to drink something more healthy such as a cup of green tea. Your provider's advice re: coffee is accurate based on the research I've seen.\\n\\nWant to pause here for a minute: IMO you  have a decent PCP! She's obviously spending a lot of time answering your questions even if you both don't quite see eye-to-eye. \\n\\n13.  Interestingly, there were just published some results from the MESA trial re: aspirin use for those with high Lp(a) that suggested aspirin (probably low dose but not sure) can lower MACE 30-40%. Worth checking out. Don't have the link to the paper but Tom Dayspring mentioned it during an Lp(a) interview on Simon Hill's The Proof podcast. About one hour 37 min. in. I'd recommend listening to the entire ep. Also listen to Attia's interview of Benoit Arsenault (The Drive, probably in 2022?) as he is a top-notch Lp(a) researcher in Canada. Both these interviews will go into the weeds w/r/t that Lp(a) is exactly. I've spent the last few years listening and reading and am only beginning to understand it all myself. There's also a youtube with an expert panel from I think NYU on Lp(a) you can search for. They do an amazing job too. If I can re-find that I'll link here later on.\\n\\nRe: your dietary and lifestyle plan, you can consider Nu Salt or similar salt substitute, especially if you feel you are at risk of hypertension (or have been diagnosed). I use this due to family history with salt-sensitive hypertension. It's a nice hack. If you don't like the taste of potassium chloride you can always go 50/50 or 75/25 with the sodium and I believe there are brands that sell those combinations.\\n\\nBest of luck to you!\", 'author': 'meh312059', 'score': 6, 'date': '2024-07-07', 'replies': [{'id': 'lc3xavh', 'name': 't1_lc3xavh', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'Great post btw', 'author': 'Henry-2k', 'score': 3, 'date': '2024-07-07'}, {'id': 'lc43166', 'name': 't1_lc43166', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'I\\'d like to try the plant based diet (thank you for the Dr. Michale Greger book link!) prior to upping the statin and/or adding Zetia as combination therapy.

Standard lipid panels don\\'t measure lipoprotein concentration, only the cholesterol content. NonHDLC consists of all cholesterol from LDL\\'s, VLDL\\'s, IDL\\'s, etc. Obviously LDL\\'s make up the majority as they have the longest residence time.\\n\\n2&3. Given the high Lp(a) - btw is that in nmol/L or mg/dl? - your LDLC/Apo B target should be under 70 mg/dl so you should consider upping your statin to a higher intensity (perhaps 20 mg. Crestor) and/or adding Zetia if your provider is willing to do it. You should also make sure you are minimizing sat fat intake and upping fiber in your diet to keep your LDLC/Apo B as naturally low as possible.\\n\\n4. Morning or evening is fine for Crestor.\\n\\n5. Even when those Lp(a) lowering drugs come on the market they likely won\\'t be indicated for primary prevention. So you might just be out of luck there (as am I with my high Lp(a)). However, if you minimize all your other risk factors and keep LDLC < 70 mg/dl you can wipe out all but the residual risk associated with Lp(a) itself. How much your residual risk is might be unknown because there\\'s just a lot they don\\'t know yet about Lp(a) and there are many variants, apparently. It\\'s a nasty but very diverse lipoprotein!! Your own family history will be telling here. Did a parent or grandparent die from early-onset heart disease, for instance.\\n\\n6.

Very active. Family history of “high” cholesterol. Grandpa on my mom’s side got heart disease in his 40’s, though he lived to 96 with medication.\\n\\nI’m a lean mass hyper responder and my cholesterol has skyrocketed to 550 after 2 months on carnivore (it was 220 a few months ago). My primary care doctor was extremely concerned and she referred me to a cardiologist for a CAC scan. \\n\\nI had the consultation for the CAC scan yesterday morning and left feeling pretty scared. First of all, the cardiologist’s bedside manner was very cold. He had a very unfeeling way of telling me I was basically going to die soon. He says I have the highest cholesterol he’s ever seen and I’m on the fast track to heart problems unless I stop my diet and get on a statin right away. Moreover, he detected abnormalities in my EKG and a bruit in one of my carotid arteries. Says he can tell from my EKG that my heart is thickening. After my last EKG at my physical 3 weeks ago, they said it looked normal. I mentioned this to the cardiologist and he said, “well, they aren’t cardiologists.” Overall, a very negative diagnosis.\\n\\nI’ve been watching a lot of Dr. Robert Cywes on YouTube recently (who is very carnivore friendly), though he recommends getting some carbs in because even though insulin resistance is bad, being insulin suppressant (which happens on the carnivore diet), isn’t ideal. Insulin apparently plays some important functions in our body, one of which is regulating cholesterol.

Last week I shared this post in another sub-reddit and many found it interesting. I thought this community may enjoy it as well. It is a more technical and scientific piece of writing.\\n\\nThe motivation to write this piece comes from the perspective that lowering LDL toward zero will cure or solve cardiovascular disease. At the present moment, I do not believe the existing body of evidence supports this claim.\\n\\n**The Residual Risk of Death and Disease Among Individuals With Optimal Levels of LDL-C and ApoB**\\n\\nOriginal Link: [www.KevinForeyMD.com/residual-risk](https://www.kevinforeymd.com/residual-risk)\\n\\n**Introduction**\\n\\nCardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death among adult men and women throughout the world. Meanwhile, a key risk factor of cardiovascular disease is elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). As a result, a significant priority among healthcare professionals and health-conscious individuals is the aggressive reduction of LDL-C levels. This has become increasingly relevant with the variety of cholesterol lowering drugs currently available, and the effectiveness of these treatments.\\n\\nImportantly, however, there are several noteworthy limitations of lowering LDL-C, and by extension, Apolipoprotein B (ApoB). The intention of this perspective is to provide broader context and understanding of LDL-C/ApoB as one of many modifiable risk factors regarding atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). Notably, there are several additional risk factors that appear to be stronger predictors of ASCVD than that of LDL/ApoB. Furthermore, many of these additional risk factors are also associated with diseases other than ASCVD, in contrast to that of LDL-C/ApoB, which are primarily recognized as risk factors of ASCVD alone.\\n\\n**General Disclaimer**\\n\\nThis content is for general educational purposes only and does not represent medical advice or the practice of medicine. Furthermore, no patient relationship is formed. Please discuss with your healthcare provider before making any dietary, lifestyle, or pharmacotherapy changes.\\n\\n**Content Summary**\\n\\n1. Lowering LDL-C as low as 30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) does not eliminate the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).\\n2. At low levels of LDL-C, there is meaningful residual risk of ASCVD attributed to non-LDL and non-ApoB risk factors.\\n3. Additional risk factors of ASCVD include insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, elevated triglycerides, which are the primary components of Metabolic Syndrome.\\n4. Several of these additional risk factors appear to be stronger predictors of premature cardiovascular disease than elevated LDL-C/ApoB.\\n5. Importantly, insulin resistance, hypertension, and elevated triglycerides also appear to be independent risk factors of several non-ASCVD diseases, including numerous cancers, dementia, infertility, kidney disease, liver disease, depression, and more.\\n6. Meanwhile, elevated LDL-C and ApoB are primarily recognized as risk factors of ASCVD alone.\\n7. While ASCVD is the single leading cause of death among adult men and women 65+ years old, it still represents a minority of overall mortality, with cancer representing the largest cause of death in younger adults ages 45-64 years old.\\n8. Therefore, individuals seeking to extend lifespan through the reduction of ASCVD and non-ASCVD diseases should seek to optimize risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome in addition to LDL-C and ApoB.\\n9. While many recommend limiting the consumption of dietary saturated fat for the sake of lowering LDL-C/ApoB, this dietary intervention has no meaningful impact on improving insulin resistance, hypertension, triglycerides, or the incidence of cancer.\\n10. While it is advisable to avoid the excess consumption of highly refined carbohydrates including sucrose and fructose, high quality clinical trials have demonstrated measurable and rapid improvements in Metabolic Syndrome and LDL-C by replacing highly processed carbohydrates with higher quality starches. Notably, these health benefits can be achieved without a reduction in calories or a reduction in carbohydrates consumed, but rather, an improved quality of carbohydrates consumed.\\n\\n**The Benefits and Limitations of Aggressive LDL-C Lowering**\\n\\nAmong individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease, elevated LDL-C and ApoB are recognized as causal risk factors for ASCVD. Additionally, the reduction of LDL-C/ApoB with lipid lowering therapy, primarily through statin therapy has resulted in reduced rates of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. With new and emerging classes of lipid lowering therapy (Ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, Bempedoic acid, Inclisiran, etc), meaningful improvements in the ability to achieve progressively lower levels of LDL-C has been achieved. Notably, with lower levels of LDL-C, further reductions in ASCVD have been demonstrated. Meanwhile, very low levels of LDL-C and ApoB have not eliminated the risk of ASCVD. To demonstrate this, the results of several landmark clinical trials will be reviewed.\\n\\n**Intensive Lipid Lowering with High-Dose Atorvastatin**\\n\\nIn a large clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness and safety of varying doses in statin therapy, more than 10,000 patients with known coronary atherosclerosis were randomized to receive either 10mg or 80mg of Atorvastatin.1 After follow-up of nearly 5 years, average LDL-C levels were 101 mg/dL for patients receiving 10mg of Atorvastatin, and 77mg/dL for patients receiving 80 mg of Atorvastatin. Heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death occurred in 10.9% of patients receiving low-dose Atorvastatin, and 8.7% of patients receiving high-dose Atorvastatin. There was no difference in overall life expectancy between the two groups.\\n\\n**AtorvastatinAverage** **LDL-C Achieved**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n|**Atorvastatin**|**Average** **LDL-C Achieved**|**Heart Attack, Stroke,** **or Cardiovascular Death**|**Lifespan Improved**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|10mg|101 mg/dL|10.9%|\\\\-|\\n|80mg|77 mg/dL|8.7%|No|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Intensive Lipid Lowering Ezetimibe Added to Statin Therapy**\\n\\nTo test the effectiveness of a non-statin therapy, a trial enrolled more than 18,000 patients who were randomized to receive Simvastatin and Ezetimibe or Simvastatin and placebo.2 After an average follow-up of 7-years, an average LDL-C level of 53.7 mg/dL was achieved in the Simvastatin–Ezetimibe group, as compared with 69.5 mg/dL in the Simvastatin–placebo group. Heart attack, stroke, or cardiac death occurred in 32.7% in the Simvastatin–Ezetimibe group, as compared with 34.7% in the Simvastatin–placebo group. There was no difference in overall life expectancy or cardiovascular mortality.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n||**Average** **LDL-C Achieved**|**Heart Attack, Stroke,** **Cardiac Death or Event**|**Lifespan Improved**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Simvastatin + Placebo|69.5 mg/dL|34.7%|\\\\-|\\n|Simvastatin + Ezetimibe|53.7 mg/dL|32.7%|No|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Intensive Lipid Lowering With PCSK9-Inhibitor Added to Statin Therapy**\\n\\nWith the emergence of PCSK9-inhibitor therapies, a separate trial enrolled more than 27,000 patients with cardiovascular disease to receive either Evolocumab and statin, or statin therapy and placebo.3 At the end of the trial, an average LDL-C of 30 mg/dL was achieved in the Evolocumab-statin group, and 92 mg/dL in the statin-placebo group. Heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death occurred in 9.8% of patients receiving Evolocumab and statin, and 11.3% receiving statin therapy and placebo. Again, there was no difference in overall life expectancy or cardiovascular mortality.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n||**Average** **LDL-C Achieved**|**Heart Attack, Stroke,** **Cardiac Death or Event**|**Lifespan Improved**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Statin + Placebo|92 mg/dL|11.3%|\\\\-|\\n|Statin + Evolocumab|30 mg/dL|9.8%|No|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Residual Risk of ASCVD With Optimal Levels of LDL-C**\\n\\nAs demonstrated above, achieving very low levels of LDL-C reduces cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. Importantly, however, significant residual risk of ASCVD exists even among those with optimal levels of LDL-C as low as 30 mg/dL. In other words, the risk of cardiovascular disease is not eliminated with very low levels of LDL-C, highlighting the risk associated with non-LDL-C and ApoB risk factors.\\n\\nMoreover, among the patients tested in these three separate trials, the use of high-dose Atorvastatin, Ezetimibe, and Evolovumab failed to improve lifespan. It can, however, be argued that healthspan was improved as a result of fewer cardiovascular events and hospitalization.\\n\\n**Searching For Residual Risk**\\n\\nTo identify additional cardiovascular risk factors other than LDL-C/ApoB, it is helpful to examine the results of a large prospective cohort study that enrolled more than 28,000 women without pre-existing heart disease, and spanned a timeframe of 21.4 years.4 In this study, diabetes and insulin resistance were the strongest risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease at any age. The heightened risk of insulin resistance and Metabolic Syndrome were followed by the risk of hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use. Elevated levels of triglycerides were a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease at all ages than elevated ApoB and non-HDL. Elevated LDL-C was the weakest predictor of cardiovascular disease among all values typically obtained on a routine lipid panel.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n|**Risk Factor**|**Heart Disease Hazard Ration, Age < 55 Years**|**Heart Disease Hazard Ration, Age 65+ Years**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Diabetes|10.71|4.49|\\n|Metabolic Syndrome|6.09|2.82|\\n|Hypertension|4.58|2.06|\\n|Obesity|4.33|2.14|\\n|Tobacco Use|3.92|1.89|\\n|Systolic BP, per SD increment|2.24|1.48|\\n|Family History|2.19|1.60|\\n|Triglycerides, per SD increment|2.14|1.61|\\n|ApoB, per SD increment|1.89|1.52|\\n|Non-HDL, per SD increment|1.67|1.41|\\n|LDL-C, per SD increment|1.38|1.24|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Justification For Optimizing Additional Risk Factors**\\n\\nLarge-scale clinical trials have repeatedly and convincingly achieved meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events through the treatment of insulin resistance, high blood pressure, body weight, and the cessation of tobacco use. In prospective cohort studies, improvements in the risk factors associated with Metabolic Syndrome have demonstrated reduced cardiovascular events, while the development of Metabolic Syndrome has demonstrated increased cardiovascular events.\\n\\nOver the past decade, increasing attention has been placed on elevated triglycerides as an independent and treatable risk-factor for ASCVD. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial, 4,162 patients hospitalized for heart attack were randomized to Atorvastatin 80 mg or Pravastatin 40 mg daily.5 Recurrent heart attack and cardiac death were lowest among patients with an LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL and a triglyceride level below 150 mg/dL. Increased rates of cardiac events were observed in those with triglyceride levels above 150 mg/dL, even when LDL-C was below 70 mg/dL. For each 10-mg/dL decrease in triglycerides, the incidence of a cardiac event was reduced by 1.4% after adjustment for LDL-C and non-HDL-C. This evidence suggests increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease attributed to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, in addition to that of ApoB particle number. This, however, remains an active area of research.\\n\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of triglyceride-lowering therapy in at-risk individuals with optimally controlled LDL-C levels, REDUCE-IT was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 8179 patients to receive statin therapy and icosapent ethyl, or statin therapy and placebo.6 At the time of enrollment, all patients had a measured serum LDL-C below 100 mg/dL and a fasting triglyceride level greater than 135 mg/dL. After an average follow-up of nearly 5 years, heart attack, stroke, a cardiovascular event or cardiovascular death occurred in 17.2% of patients in the icosapent ethyl group, compared with 22.0% in the placebo group. Icosapent ethyl is now FDA-approved the cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with elevated triglycerides and pre-existing heart disease and/or diabetes.\\n\\n**The Impact of Metabolic Syndrome Beyond Cardiovascular Disease**\\n\\nWhile it can be argued that Metabolic Syndrome and its individual components are stronger risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease at any age, it is even more apparent that Metabolic Syndrome contributes to a much wider spectrum of illnesses than elevated LDL-C/ApoB, extending far beyond that of atherosclerosis. This appears particularly important for young individuals who are experiencing increasing rates of cancer at younger ages, for which a clear explanation has not been identified. \\u200b\\u200b\\n\\nRegarding the negative health impacts of insulin resistance, there is a growing body of evidence identifying persistently elevated levels of insulin (hyperinsulinemia) as a risk factor associated with certain cancers in genetically susceptible individuals.7 This is particularly apparent in several gastrointestinal malignancies, including gastric cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, pancreatic cancer, and possibly colon cancer. Several studies have explored the link between hyperinsulinemia and cancer development, including insulin’s ability to promote cell proliferation and inhibit programmed cell death through the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway.\\n\\nSeparately, hyperinsulinemia contributes to inflammation throughout the body and blood vessels, heightening the risk of blood vessel injury and thrombosis (blood clot). Mendellian randomization has identified elevated levels of triglyceride-rich containing lipoproteins as a causal risk factor of increased inflammation and elevated C-reactive protein, which is not observed with elevated levels of LDL-C.8\\n\\nCollectively, insulin resistance and individual components of Metabolic Syndrome contribute to a wide spectrum of illness detailed below.\\n\\n**Components of Metabolic Syndrome**\\n\\n|1. Insulin Resistance|2. Visceral Adiposity|3. Hypertension|\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|4. Elevated Triglycerides|5. Low HDL Cholesterol||\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Diseases Associated With Metabolic Syndrome**\\n\\n|Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke|10+ Cancers and Inflammation|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|Other Diseases of Atherosclerosis|Infertility, Low Testosterone, PCOS|\\n|Dementia and Vascular Dementia|Pre-Eclampsia and Pregnancy Loss|\\n|Kidney Disease and Liver Disease|Infection, Heartburn, Arthritis, Gout|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**ASCVD Accounts for A Minority of Deaths Among Adults and Young Adults**\\n\\nAgain, while atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are the number one cause of death in adults, as of 2020, cardiovascular disease was responsible for less than 28% of all deaths in men and women ages 65 and older in the United States.9 In other words, among all deaths in adult men and women, more than 70% were due to illness other than cardiovascular disease and stroke, for which the optimization of LDL-C will likely have no benefit. When looking at younger individuals ages 45-64 years old who died prematurely, less than 23% of deaths were attributed to heart disease or stroke. Rather, cancer is the number one cause of death in this age group\\n\\nCollectively, the observations highlight the importance of optimizing comprehensive metabolic health, with particular attention to the individual components of metabolic syndrome, which is in addition to LDL-C/ApoB for the sake of cardiovascular risk reduction.\\n\\n**Dietary Recommendations**\\n\\nWhile many recommend limiting the consumption of dietary saturated fat for the sake of lowering LDL-C/ApoB, this dietary intervention does not lead to improvements in insulin resistance, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or the incidence of cancer.10 In randomized trials of at least a 12-month duration, Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets have demonstrated more favorable improvements in weight loss, insulin resistance, and triglycerides compared to low-fat diets, which are currently recommended by the World Health Organization.11-13\\n\\nImportantly, randomized trials have also demonstrated that dietary restriction of refined sugars alone, namely sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup, with isocaloric substitution of complex carbohydrates results in appreciable reductions in body weight, insulin resistance, blood pressure, LDL-C, and triglycerides, independent of caloric intake and carbohydrate intake.14,15 Excessive alcohol consumption is also recognized as a modifiable dietary lifestyle risk factor associated with elevated serum triglycerides and poor health outcome.16,17 Therefore, in addition to promoting weight loss and regular physical exercise, healthcare professional and health conscious individuals should seek to minimize or eliminate the consumption of added and refined sugars, highly processed foods, and excessive alcohol consumption.\\n\\n**Cardiorespiratory Fitness**\\n\\nIn addition to the negative health impacts of all risk factors previously discussed, cardiorespiratory fitness appears to be a stronger predictor of death and disease than obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cholesterol abnormalities. In other words, our physical fitness, or lack thereof, is the strongest predictor of longevity, health, and wellness. Therefore, for optimal risk reduction of preventable medical illness, it is important to optimize both cardiorespiratory fitness and metabolic health.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\nSee below in comments.', 'subreddit': 'Cholesterol', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rae2', 'score': 58, 'upvotes': 62, 'num_comments': 85, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/19bbxbg/the_residual_risk_of_death_and_disease_among/', 'date': '2024-01-20', 'comments': [{'id': 'kiqlyqy', 'name': 't1_kiqlyqy', 'parent_id': 't3_19bbxbg', 'link_id': 't3_19bbxbg', 'text': 'The TLDR here is: High LDL / ApoB are not the only potential risks for cardiovascular disease and exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, managing blood pressure, not smoking, consuming as little alcohol as you can, having regular physicals (to check for afib, etc) - among other things - are all factors. \\n\\nAs this isn’t a cardiovascular disease sub, we do tend to focus just on the subject of the sub.

For example, you highlight statin trials indicating that, the lower LDL is held in said groups, the fewer events, but without clear impact on mortality over a few years.  As a sidenote on this, as you highlighted yourself, the absolute odds of death in those few years from cardiovascular disease is of course limited, and failure to find differences are generally ascribed to insufficient powering, unless the argument is seriously \"there is a log-linear reduction in risk of cardiovascular events with reduction in LDL but this will never translate to mortality over the longer term.\"\\n\\nBut you also highlight nutritional interventions such as \"low carb,\" which for some reason you put in the same bucket as \"Mediterranean,\" without seemingly applying the same criteria as to its efficacy.  The conflation of these two is confusing to me because, as you yourself pointed out, we actually do have good evidence for Mediterranean diets influencing disease hard endpoints, but to the best of my knowledge, we do *not* have that same evidence in low carb trials.  Out of curiosity, do you have any intervention trials which demonstrate that any \"low carb\" (typically defined as carbohydrate intake <= ~100 grams in the research) diet has any meaningful impact on any disease state hard endpoints, e.g. cardiovascular disease events or mortality?

I was eating only ~6g of saturated fat per day. Fiber at ~89g/day. Why would an ultra low fat diet increase LDL-C by so much?\\n\\n**Small LDL Particles**: The rise in small LDL-P caught me by surprise.

It's fundamentally the same process that is responsible for the increasing incidence of NAFLD even in young people who overconsume carbs.\\n\\nYour total energy intake has increased from ~2800 to ~3200 kcal/d. Even if this is actually your maintenance expenditure atm, it's plausible that the high carb intake is causing your glycogen stores to be almost fully saturated most of the time. Consequently, during acute feeding bouts the amount of carbs in the meal is just too high to be utilized efficiently, and the liver cranks up lipid synthesis because the carbs have nowhere else to go.\\n\\nA balanced meal is easier to dispose of, as the fat content goes straight to adipose (to be released later in the fasting state), while the carb content goes mostly towards oxidation and glycogen storage. As you reduce the proportion of fat, you increase the demand for carb disposal capacity, which is very limited compared to fat storage capacity.

It's fundamentally the same process that is responsible for the increasing incidence of NAFLD even in young people who overconsume carbs.\\n\\nYour total energy intake has increased from ~2800 to ~3200 kcal/d. Even if this is actually your maintenance expenditure atm, it's plausible that the high carb intake is causing your glycogen stores to be almost fully saturated most of the time. Consequently, during acute feeding bouts the amount of carbs in the meal is just too high to be utilized efficiently, and the liver cranks up lipid synthesis because the carbs have nowhere else to go.\\n\\nA balanced meal is easier to dispose of, as the fat content goes straight to adipose (to be released later in the fasting state), while the carb content goes mostly towards oxidation and glycogen storage. As you reduce the proportion of fat, you increase the demand for carb disposal capacity, which is very limited compared to fat storage capacity.

Physiologically, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) attenuates LDLR function by binding to the LDLR extracellular domain, leading to its lysosomal degradation and thereby preventing the total depletion of circulating LDL-C. However, pathogenic variants of PCSK9 are able to reduce the availability of LDLR, thus significantly increasing plasma LDL-C levels. Despite this understanding, the detailed molecular mechanism of LDLR-PCSK9 interaction remains elusive due to the lack of a full atomistic structure of LDLR. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to predict LDLR structural dynamics upon binding to PCSK9. Furthermore, two PCSK9 variants, E498A and R499G that were identified in clinically diagnosed Malaysian FH patients were investigated for their mutational effects. The simulations, spanning 500 ns, were conducted for three LDLR-PCSK9 complexes: LDLR-PCSK9 wild-type (WT), LDLR-PCSK9 (E498A), and LDLR-PCSK9 (R499G). Throughout the simulations, PCSK9 structure remained highly stable, in contrast to the LDLR structure that sampled large conformational space. The WT complex exhibited the least change, whereas the R499G complex displayed the most pronounced conformational rearrangement. During the simulations of WT and E498A complexes, the beta-propeller domain of LDLR formed interactions with the prodomain of PCSK9.

I do not have FH but have high LDL and low HDL due to the steroids. Unfortunately my libido is very low and I have poor erectile quality and lethargy without it every time I have tried to lower the dosage so I really think I need it for my life quality. My father took statins in his old age but he tolerated them very poorly and had many side effects - like myalgia - so I doubt I would be able to take them. Sometimes I get angina in my chest, which worries me, but just I can't go through life as a young man with a dead member and no energy or libido.\\n\\nI've even thought about paying out of pocket for a PCSK9 inhibitor despite the absurd cost, but it makes me wonder why they're so hard to get. They seem to crush LDL with very few side effects compared to statins. Why are they only approved by the FDA for FH, unstable angina, and CAD? Is there any plan to make them more available to the general public who suffer from high cholesterol as possibly even a prophylactic? Do the drug companies even want them to be approved more generally by the FDA?\\n\\nI don't understand why they haven't been approved and covered by insurance more broadly?

The major classes of commonly prescribed lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, clearly increase circulating PCSK9 levels and which likely diminishes the effect of these drugs on the reduction of LDL-C concentrations.

Fatty streaks are different from, and not precursors of atherosclerotic plaques. This myth that fatty streaks lead to atherosclerosis is alarmist nonsense, coming from those that profit off the hysteria, or those that did not properly research the disease. https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/19bzo1j/fatty_streaks_are_not_precursors_of/\\n\\n\\n> Ldl of 55 or less is the number if you never want to worry about heart attack.\\n\\nAgain nonsense. Heart disease is response to injury like all chronic diseases, it is a consequence of your artery wall cells being damaged one way or another. Even with hypothetical zero LDL levels, you still get heart disease from smoking, pollution, diabetes, and trans fats. The presentation might be slightly different, but you would still die nonetheless from the damaged arteries. Here is an example thread where this topic was discussed to death: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1eindnr/risk_factors_leading_to_a_heart_attack/\\n\\n\\n> no diet or lifestyle is ever gonna sustain that number \\n\\nThat should have been a dead giveaway that something ain't clapping. Plenty of people avoid heart disease even without fairyland levels of LDL.\\n\\n\\n> unless you are one of the lucky bastards with genetic mutation such as PCSK9 or FHBL who no matter what they eat have low levels of ldl.\\n\\nThose mutations have serious side effects, they are not that lucky as you claim. And again they can still easily get heart disease from the aforementioned risk factors. LDL is not necessary at all for you to wreck your arteries.\\n\\n\\n> There is no other way around it i mean how long can you keep up a life with 40g fiber 10g sat fat the rest of your life?\\n\\nYou do not need to, virtually every healthy diet causes atherosclerosis regression, even low carbohydrate diets that have a tendency to elevate LDL (because of higher lipolysis and VLDL stability).\\n\\nShai, I., Spence, J.

Since joining about a week ago, I have scoured posts about low saturated fat diets, Peter Attia (sp?), Lilly clinical trials, etc. I spoke with my doctor about the following questions and was met with a very haulted response in that I don\\'t pose a threat right now. Basically, the phone conversation I had with her left me with feeling like I\\'m overreacting because I am only 37 and not \"currently\" at risk. I mentioned to her that I have a young child and my mother died young (64,  pancreatic cancer) and I am trying to be as proactive (as Kaiser markets themselves and prides themselves as being) as possible. She couldn\\'t get off the phone with me fast enough and was pretty combative with my research based responses, basically saying it without saying it that she was the doctor and this is what they know now. Any advice on the following (doctor\\'s response in parenthesis) is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.\\n\\n  \\nStats: 37 year old female, 5\\'2\", 158 lbs, Teacher (active, but not ACTIVE)\\n\\nHere goes:\\n\\n  \\n1. Based on my most recent blood test, my cholesterol went from in September 154 to 191 (normal value is <199), my triglycerides went from 76 to 87 (normal value is <149), my HDL went from 48 to 58 (normal value is > 40), my LDL went from 91 to 117 (normal value is <99), my Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein went from 3.3 to 3.2 (normal value is <3.9; so relatively the same), and my cholesterol (non-HDL) went from 106 to 133 (nonHDL targets are 30 mg higher than LDL targets; what does that mean)? Can you determine what happened?\\xa0(She didn\\'t seem to be concerned with this \"spike\" and didn\\'t know what caused it. Thoughts on the above numbers? I did have my thyroid tested test came back normal, so no caused for concern about hypothyroidism)\\n\\n2. I have been pretty diligent with my 10 mg statin and have been religious with my statin since my lipid panel on 6/22. Would you recommend upping my statin or just retesting in a few months? Are there negative reasons for raising a statin? (She doesn\\'t want to raise my statin at this time, because there can be negative risk factors with upping a statin. She said that 10mg is the \"highest\" for low to moderate risk patients, and because there is no family risk, she wanted to stay put at 10mg).\\n\\n3. I am interested in possibly taking Ezetimibe with my statin as combination therapy or a PCSK9 inhibitor like Repatha. Do you recommend any low dose aspirin? (She ordered a lipid panel for October, three months from now, and said she would prescribe me Zetia if I wanted to move forward with that at that time; Thoughts?)\\n\\n4. When is the best time to take my statin\\xa0for maximum absorption? (She mentioned that since I take Crestor, taking it right before bed is best. She said that taking it with a CoQ10 doesn\\'t mess up absorption, but that I should take CoQ10 before a meal and then my statin before bed and I will be fine).\\n\\n5. I am very concerned with my Lipoprotein A results. I know that the normal value is <75 and I was shocked to see that my value is 301. From what I understand, this is a result of genetic high cholesterol and from what I understand, there is currently no medication to lower lipoprotein a levels, but that you need to maintain a low LDL and basically take care of everything else to minimize your risk of strokes, heart attacks, etc. (This is where she got pretty combatative with me and frustrated and explained that is why this test is not normally done because the information just basically becomes an FYI witht much to do with it. I explained to her that I\\'m an information person and basically having a baseline is helpful to me so that I can do everything in my power to control other factors, since I can\\'t do much about this number. She agreed and said that there are many things in the works right now in terms of how to treat LPa (like what is going on with Lilly and that they just don\\'t know how to move forward right now). This is where she got pretty combatative with information and \"being in the know\" such as a doctor and that she realizes that this information isn\\'t readily available to people outside of the medical field, so she forwarded me this information in regards to LPa levels:\\n\\n  \\nThere is limited evidence indicating that Lp(a) lowering reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (see \\'Disease associations\\' above). Thus, except in very rare cases, we do not target Lp(a) with any therapy known to lower Lp(a). (See \\'Next steps\\' below.)\\xa0Initial approach — Our initial approach to reducing ASCVD risk in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to its target. (See \"Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease\" and \"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease\".)\\xa0Usually this involves treatment with a statin, with or without ezetimibe. Statins increase Lp(a) levels \\\\[58\\\\]. However, the impact of this increase on cardiovascular events is not known and is felt to be small \\\\[42,59\\\\]. Ezetimibe does not lower Lp(a).\\xa0Some patients who cannot achieve an optimal LDL-C with statin plus ezetimibe are treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor. In the FOURIER trial, Lp(a) reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was associated with ASCVD risk reduction independent of LDL-C lowering, as discussed below \\\\[41\\\\]. Thus, very high-risk patients with high Lp(a) levels may benefit disproportionately from a lipid-lowering strategy that includes a PCSK9 inhibitor. In a post-hoc analysis of ODYSSEY outcomes, participants with LDL-C levels between 55 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL with a Lp(a) level above the median of 13.6 mg/dL had fewer cardiovascular disease events on treatment with alirocumab \\\\[60\\\\].\\xa0Next steps — For patients with elevated Lp(a) who have reached their LDL-C target or who have received all recommended therapies to lower LDL-C, we await definitive evidence from ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials with selective Lp(a)-lowering therapies and do not have any broader recommendations on Lp(a) lowering.\\xa0The use of these therapies in this setting has not been proven in prospectively designed clinical outcome trials. In addition, there are costs to these therapies.\\n\\n6. Do statins raise lipoprotein a levels?\\xa0(She said she didn\\'t know; that there are mixed results in this, but basically I am not a candidate who truly \"can\\'t\" take a statin, so the benefits outweight the costs)\\n\\n7. My goal is to get my LDL below 40 (need to go down 77 points) and keep my HDL above 45. I would like to test my ApoB (that should be in the 40s). How long would it take to get my LDL down to 40-what extreme measures do I need to do?\\xa0(She said that it\\'s possible to get my LDL down as close to 40, but that it is really hard to do and would account for a \"pretty miserable life\" and that she \"wasn\\'t sure how I would feel with an LDL that low\" since our body needs some cholesterol to function. She said that testing for ApoB is mute at this point (in the similar vein to testing for LPa) since it\\'s just FYI information and then what do I do with it if the range is out of normal, when the only current response is to treat with a statin, which I\\'m doing. She said that the \"extreme measure\" I could do at this time is to become plant based with my diet)\\n\\n8. I would like to meet with a cardiologist, and a lipidologist and endocrinologist, if possible. (She didn\\'t respond to the need to meet with a lipidologist or endocrinologist (I\\'m not sure if this is possible through Kaiser), but did put in a referral for a cardiologist, with obvious hesitation, as she thinks the referral will get bounced back. I mentioned that aren\\'t a risk patient due to my numbers, and was met with a similar response that because my risk is currently low, with an assumption that cardiologists are dealing with more severe cases and there isn\\'t much availability. She put in the referral and said that if it gets bounced back, that I would have to go through member services and make an appointment on my own, if it is okayed. \\\\*\\\\*This is where my major frustration is coming from. I don\\'t feel like my situation should be diluted solely based on the severity of what other people are going through. This is apples and oranges and I am trying to be proactive. I wil absolutely be following up with the cardiologist referral and next steps.\"\"\\n\\n9. I would like to schedule a CAC, an APoB test, and an APoA test. Would you recommend that I have a CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) or angiogram to see my plaque levels? I know it may show 0, but wouldn\\'t it be smart to have a baseline? (She said that the CAC is a test she can\\'t put a referral in for, but that the cardiologist would have to do that. She seemed to skate over ordering the APoB and APoa test, but I am sure her response will be that it is just \"more information\" that I just can do nothing about. I plan on asking my hopefully referred cardiologists about all of these tests)\\n\\n10. Should I be paying attention to Hs-CRP (inflammation), LP-PLA2 (enzyme to measure plaque activity), hba1c (blood sugar)?\\xa0(I didn\\'t ask her this question, but was wondering if any of you have any insight on monitoring any of these?)\\n\\n11. I\\'ve also heard that Niacin and/or CoQ10 can be helpful in lowering LDL (and possibly lipoprotein a). I\\'ve started taking 100 mgs of Coq10 and 3 tsps daily of Metamucil as a soluble fiber, since I know both of these things can help with lowering LDL. Should I continue CoQ10 & Metamucil? Would you also recommend taking Niacin and/or Fish Oil or any omegas? Keep with Metamucil or straight psyllium husk? Can psyllium husk affect the absorption of my statins? (She said that taking Niacin with me already being on a statin is not necessary nor recommended, due to the risks that niacin can cause. She said takign CoQ10 is smart since LDL can mess with the CoQ10 levels in our body and taking it as a supplement helps with that. She didn\\'t speak it to possibly lowering my LPa, though. She said taking Metamucil is great and that upping fiber in my diet is really smart. She said that Fish Oil has been pretty controversial and that it is actually showing some signs of being harmful (or not helpful) for people in my situation. She said that Metamucil of straight psyllium husk is fine and that psyllium husk does not affect the absoption of my statins)\\n\\n12. I\\'ve also read that a plant based diet is basically smart for someone in my situation. Would you recommend that I become a vegetarian, as well as avoiding cheese and eggs? Or just a low-carb diet? Should I be avoiding alcohol entirely? What is the recommended % of saturated fats that I should be staying under daily-less than 10mg?? Effects of coffee? Should I be intermittent fasting? I know that diet and exercise won\\'t affect the lipoprotein a, but it seems like I might need an extreme lifestyle change to really get my bad cholesterol levels as low as possible to help combat the lipoprotein a levels I can\\'t do much about. (She confirmed that if my goal is lower my rish of cardiovascular disease as much as possible, that switching to a plant-based diet and avoiding as much animal biproducts as possible is a must. She recommended avoiding cheed and eggs, but didn\\'t mention anything about going low carb. In terms of alcohol, she laughed in the fact that, \"Samantha! You\\'re 37 years old! You can have a drink  two a party and not worry about it!\" basically contributing to the notion that she \"said it without saying it\" that I am overreacting, and I really do not feel like I am. She confirmed that getting daily saturated fats down to 10mg a day is ideal, but really hard to do and that the best way to keep it as low as possible is with going plant based. She said that coffee is good for you and that it\\'s what we put in coffee that messes things up. I told her I have my coffee with stevia drops and oatmilk and she said that is fine. She said that intermittent fasting is controversial and that she would not recommend.)\\n\\n13. Are there any clinical trials available for people with my similar results? (She said that she is sure there are clinical trials but that she was unaware of them and it isn\\'t her wheelhouse or recommendation).\\n\\n  \\nWHEW! So, that is a summary sentence of the phone conversation. I am left with an action plan of: 1) another lipid panel in October 2024 2) keeping my statin at 10mg 3) going plant based in my diet 4) put in a refferal for a cardiologist. I feel like \"switching doctors\" within Kaiser will just provide me with another doctor in the network with the same response. Any other suggestions for me at this time?\\n\\nI\\'ve also been taking down some notes with the beneficial information from this feed. I am aware of this website [https://www.lpaclinicalguidance.com/](https://www.lpaclinicalguidance.com/) ~and find myself focusing on the following exercise and diet notes.

You may not need to get your LDLC/Apo B that low and you are best off following sensible prevention strategies in terms of diet and lifestyle so that you don't have to go too aggressive on the medications. Plant-based is certainly an option should you want to pursue that because it eliminates any dietary cholesterol (in case you are an over-absorber), it minimizes sat fat as long as you aren't consuming coconut or palm oil, and it's very high in fiber. If you do go that route make sure to take a B12. BTW you can always order testing independently via [ownyourlabs.com](http://ownyourlabs.com) which uses LabCorp. (Update: or Precision Health Reports mentioned below). \\n\\n8. It's understandable you want to meet with these specialists but they are likely not going to be able to give you more insight than you've been able to gather already (and in about 1/100th of the amount of time as well so congrats there!). What is your A1C currently? Do you have T2D in the family? One thing you might do if you suspect fatty liver is request a liver US of your PCP which should be a no-brainer to order. Get a CAC scan too, while you are at it - 37 with high Lp(a) isn't too young for that. Another test you'll want to do over the next year or so is a carotid US esp. if the CAC comes back with a 0 score. \\n\\n9. Ah ok - yes you should go to the cardiologist for the CAC and carotid US too I guess. Or a CIMT if Kaiser has access to one. The other test that should be on your radar going forward is the ankle-brachia index. All three: CAC, CUS, and ABI are recommended by Dr. Bill Cromwell who is a top lipidologist and clinical researcher with a youtube presence via interview. He's also medical director at Precision Health Reports and they do a comprehensive cardiometabolic assessment for $249. I found them very useful as a supplement to the usual care I get from my own health system (not Kaiser but it also has its limits . . . ). Check them out if you want: [Precisionhealthreports.com](http://Precisionhealthreports.com)\\n\\n10. Yes. One advantage of the precision health reports resource is that they measure LP-IR and GlycA. I found both to be very helpful. Now you can order these via ownyourlabs too if you want. Both Precision and Ownyourlabs use LabCorp for the bloodwork. But Precision Health Reports has a wonderful user-friendly format where all the detailed testing is explained to me. Costs about an extra $100 for that but hey, I found it worth it. Precision Health reports also will test either Apo B or do the LDL particle count itself. I just did Apo B as it's basically just one number with the same info conveyed as a more complicated LDL particle count result.\\n\\n11. Dont' take Niacin. It's not been clinically shown to improve outcomes with high Lp(a) and the side effects including flushing, possible high LFT's and other stuff can be a problem. Psyllium husk is great, CoQ10 hasn't really been shown to be effective but many swear by it. Use it if you need to for muscle pain but other than that it might not be necessary.\\n\\n12. Best not to go LC. You are better off doing plant-based (IMO but that's backed by the research). The problem with LC is that it's usually accompanied by high fat (as in LC/HF or Keto). Keto can spike your LDLC/Apo B. Plant based will lower it. See Dr. Michael Greger's books or his website [Nutritionfacts.org](http://Nutritionfacts.org) if you need more info on going plant-based. As for alcohol, the latest research - in AHA's journal *Hypertension* -  is that even one drink per day can raise BP over the long term. I've had this discussion with my providers as well and some of them think I'm nuts lol. The reality is that there's simply no safe level of ethanol. Now, can one drink a week be harmful? Probably not. But every alcoholic beverage is a missed opportunity to drink something more healthy such as a cup of green tea. Your provider's advice re: coffee is accurate based on the research I've seen.\\n\\nWant to pause here for a minute: IMO you  have a decent PCP! She's obviously spending a lot of time answering your questions even if you both don't quite see eye-to-eye. \\n\\n13.  Interestingly, there were just published some results from the MESA trial re: aspirin use for those with high Lp(a) that suggested aspirin (probably low dose but not sure) can lower MACE 30-40%. Worth checking out. Don't have the link to the paper but Tom Dayspring mentioned it during an Lp(a) interview on Simon Hill's The Proof podcast. About one hour 37 min. in. I'd recommend listening to the entire ep. Also listen to Attia's interview of Benoit Arsenault (The Drive, probably in 2022?) as he is a top-notch Lp(a) researcher in Canada. Both these interviews will go into the weeds w/r/t that Lp(a) is exactly. I've spent the last few years listening and reading and am only beginning to understand it all myself. There's also a youtube with an expert panel from I think NYU on Lp(a) you can search for. They do an amazing job too. If I can re-find that I'll link here later on.\\n\\nRe: your dietary and lifestyle plan, you can consider Nu Salt or similar salt substitute, especially if you feel you are at risk of hypertension (or have been diagnosed). I use this due to family history with salt-sensitive hypertension. It's a nice hack. If you don't like the taste of potassium chloride you can always go 50/50 or 75/25 with the sodium and I believe there are brands that sell those combinations.\\n\\nBest of luck to you!\", 'author': 'meh312059', 'score': 6, 'date': '2024-07-07', 'replies': [{'id': 'lc3xavh', 'name': 't1_lc3xavh', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'Great post btw', 'author': 'Henry-2k', 'score': 3, 'date': '2024-07-07'}, {'id': 'lc43166', 'name': 't1_lc43166', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'I\\'d like to try the plant based diet (thank you for the Dr. Michale Greger book link!) prior to upping the statin and/or adding Zetia as combination therapy.

Given the high Lp(a) - btw is that in nmol/L or mg/dl? - your LDLC/Apo B target should be under 70 mg/dl so you should consider upping your statin to a higher intensity (perhaps 20 mg.

You may not need to get your LDLC/Apo B that low and you are best off following sensible prevention strategies in terms of diet and lifestyle so that you don't have to go too aggressive on the medications. Plant-based is certainly an option should you want to pursue that because it eliminates any dietary cholesterol (in case you are an over-absorber), it minimizes sat fat as long as you aren't consuming coconut or palm oil, and it's very high in fiber. If you do go that route make sure to take a B12. BTW you can always order testing independently via [ownyourlabs.com](http://ownyourlabs.com) which uses LabCorp. (Update: or Precision Health Reports mentioned below). \\n\\n8. It's understandable you want to meet with these specialists but they are likely not going to be able to give you more insight than you've been able to gather already (and in about 1/100th of the amount of time as well so congrats there!). What is your A1C currently? Do you have T2D in the family? One thing you might do if you suspect fatty liver is request a liver US of your PCP which should be a no-brainer to order. Get a CAC scan too, while you are at it - 37 with high Lp(a) isn't too young for that. Another test you'll want to do over the next year or so is a carotid US esp. if the CAC comes back with a 0 score. \\n\\n9. Ah ok - yes you should go to the cardiologist for the CAC and carotid US too I guess. Or a CIMT if Kaiser has access to one. The other test that should be on your radar going forward is the ankle-brachia index. All three: CAC, CUS, and ABI are recommended by Dr. Bill Cromwell who is a top lipidologist and clinical researcher with a youtube presence via interview. He's also medical director at Precision Health Reports and they do a comprehensive cardiometabolic assessment for $249. I found them very useful as a supplement to the usual care I get from my own health system (not Kaiser but it also has its limits . . . ). Check them out if you want: [Precisionhealthreports.com](http://Precisionhealthreports.com)\\n\\n10. Yes. One advantage of the precision health reports resource is that they measure LP-IR and GlycA. I found both to be very helpful. Now you can order these via ownyourlabs too if you want. Both Precision and Ownyourlabs use LabCorp for the bloodwork. But Precision Health Reports has a wonderful user-friendly format where all the detailed testing is explained to me. Costs about an extra $100 for that but hey, I found it worth it. Precision Health reports also will test either Apo B or do the LDL particle count itself. I just did Apo B as it's basically just one number with the same info conveyed as a more complicated LDL particle count result.\\n\\n11. Dont' take Niacin. It's not been clinically shown to improve outcomes with high Lp(a) and the side effects including flushing, possible high LFT's and other stuff can be a problem. Psyllium husk is great, CoQ10 hasn't really been shown to be effective but many swear by it. Use it if you need to for muscle pain but other than that it might not be necessary.\\n\\n12. Best not to go LC. You are better off doing plant-based (IMO but that's backed by the research). The problem with LC is that it's usually accompanied by high fat (as in LC/HF or Keto). Keto can spike your LDLC/Apo B. Plant based will lower it. See Dr. Michael Greger's books or his website [Nutritionfacts.org](http://Nutritionfacts.org) if you need more info on going plant-based. As for alcohol, the latest research - in AHA's journal *Hypertension* -  is that even one drink per day can raise BP over the long term. I've had this discussion with my providers as well and some of them think I'm nuts lol. The reality is that there's simply no safe level of ethanol. Now, can one drink a week be harmful? Probably not. But every alcoholic beverage is a missed opportunity to drink something more healthy such as a cup of green tea. Your provider's advice re: coffee is accurate based on the research I've seen.\\n\\nWant to pause here for a minute: IMO you  have a decent PCP! She's obviously spending a lot of time answering your questions even if you both don't quite see eye-to-eye. \\n\\n13.  Interestingly, there were just published some results from the MESA trial re: aspirin use for those with high Lp(a) that suggested aspirin (probably low dose but not sure) can lower MACE 30-40%. Worth checking out. Don't have the link to the paper but Tom Dayspring mentioned it during an Lp(a) interview on Simon Hill's The Proof podcast. About one hour 37 min. in. I'd recommend listening to the entire ep. Also listen to Attia's interview of Benoit Arsenault (The Drive, probably in 2022?) as he is a top-notch Lp(a) researcher in Canada. Both these interviews will go into the weeds w/r/t that Lp(a) is exactly. I've spent the last few years listening and reading and am only beginning to understand it all myself. There's also a youtube with an expert panel from I think NYU on Lp(a) you can search for. They do an amazing job too. If I can re-find that I'll link here later on.\\n\\nRe: your dietary and lifestyle plan, you can consider Nu Salt or similar salt substitute, especially if you feel you are at risk of hypertension (or have been diagnosed). I use this due to family history with salt-sensitive hypertension. It's a nice hack. If you don't like the taste of potassium chloride you can always go 50/50 or 75/25 with the sodium and I believe there are brands that sell those combinations.\\n\\nBest of luck to you!\", 'author': 'meh312059', 'score': 6, 'date': '2024-07-07', 'replies': [{'id': 'lc3xavh', 'name': 't1_lc3xavh', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'Great post btw', 'author': 'Henry-2k', 'score': 3, 'date': '2024-07-07'}, {'id': 'lc43166', 'name': 't1_lc43166', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'I\\'d like to try the plant based diet (thank you for the Dr. Michale Greger book link!) prior to upping the statin and/or adding Zetia as combination therapy.

Standard lipid panels don\\'t measure lipoprotein concentration, only the cholesterol content. NonHDLC consists of all cholesterol from LDL\\'s, VLDL\\'s, IDL\\'s, etc. Obviously LDL\\'s make up the majority as they have the longest residence time.\\n\\n2&3. Given the high Lp(a) - btw is that in nmol/L or mg/dl? - your LDLC/Apo B target should be under 70 mg/dl so you should consider upping your statin to a higher intensity (perhaps 20 mg. Crestor) and/or adding Zetia if your provider is willing to do it. You should also make sure you are minimizing sat fat intake and upping fiber in your diet to keep your LDLC/Apo B as naturally low as possible.\\n\\n4. Morning or evening is fine for Crestor.\\n\\n5.

Very active. Family history of “high” cholesterol. Grandpa on my mom’s side got heart disease in his 40’s, though he lived to 96 with medication.\\n\\nI’m a lean mass hyper responder and my cholesterol has skyrocketed to 550 after 2 months on carnivore (it was 220 a few months ago). My primary care doctor was extremely concerned and she referred me to a cardiologist for a CAC scan. \\n\\nI had the consultation for the CAC scan yesterday morning and left feeling pretty scared. First of all, the cardiologist’s bedside manner was very cold. He had a very unfeeling way of telling me I was basically going to die soon. He says I have the highest cholesterol he’s ever seen and I’m on the fast track to heart problems unless I stop my diet and get on a statin right away. Moreover, he detected abnormalities in my EKG and a bruit in one of my carotid arteries. Says he can tell from my EKG that my heart is thickening. After my last EKG at my physical 3 weeks ago, they said it looked normal. I mentioned this to the cardiologist and he said, “well, they aren’t cardiologists.” Overall, a very negative diagnosis.\\n\\nI’ve been watching a lot of Dr. Robert Cywes on YouTube recently (who is very carnivore friendly), though he recommends getting some carbs in because even though insulin resistance is bad, being insulin suppressant (which happens on the carnivore diet), isn’t ideal. Insulin apparently plays some important functions in our body, one of which is regulating cholesterol. He gave the case study of a carnivore with 590 cholesterol who later saw his cholesterol go down to 260 after incorporating whole milk and berries. The man’s free testosterone also increased. And his blood sugar and triglycerides went down notably.\\n\\nAnyways, Im scheduled for an echocardiogram next week along with my CAC test. I’m also getting my blood redrawn this weekend to see if adding back in 75-100g of fruit and milk does anything for my blood numbers.\\n\\nBut yeah, the cardiologist really put the fear of God in me. For the last 24 hours, I’ve been ruminating over all my regrets in life and watching clips from Gladiator to get myself more comfortable with potentially dying soon. Unfortunately, I still have to wait quite a while to get the echocardiogram, CAC, and blood work done, and then I need to wait until September to have the results interpreted.

My name is Kevin. I am a physician with a specialized interest in food, nutrition, cholesterol, and metabolic disease. Last week I shared this post in another sub-reddit and many found it interesting. I thought this community may enjoy it as well. It is a more technical and scientific piece of writing.\\n\\nThe motivation to write this piece comes from the perspective that lowering LDL toward zero will cure or solve cardiovascular disease. At the present moment, I do not believe the existing body of evidence supports this claim.\\n\\n**The Residual Risk of Death and Disease Among Individuals With Optimal Levels of LDL-C and ApoB**\\n\\nOriginal Link: [www.KevinForeyMD.com/residual-risk](https://www.kevinforeymd.com/residual-risk)\\n\\n**Introduction**\\n\\nCardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death among adult men and women throughout the world. Meanwhile, a key risk factor of cardiovascular disease is elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). As a result, a significant priority among healthcare professionals and health-conscious individuals is the aggressive reduction of LDL-C levels. This has become increasingly relevant with the variety of cholesterol lowering drugs currently available, and the effectiveness of these treatments.\\n\\nImportantly, however, there are several noteworthy limitations of lowering LDL-C, and by extension, Apolipoprotein B (ApoB). The intention of this perspective is to provide broader context and understanding of LDL-C/ApoB as one of many modifiable risk factors regarding atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD). Notably, there are several additional risk factors that appear to be stronger predictors of ASCVD than that of LDL/ApoB. Furthermore, many of these additional risk factors are also associated with diseases other than ASCVD, in contrast to that of LDL-C/ApoB, which are primarily recognized as risk factors of ASCVD alone.\\n\\n**General Disclaimer**\\n\\nThis content is for general educational purposes only and does not represent medical advice or the practice of medicine. Furthermore, no patient relationship is formed. Please discuss with your healthcare provider before making any dietary, lifestyle, or pharmacotherapy changes.\\n\\n**Content Summary**\\n\\n1. Lowering LDL-C as low as 30 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L) does not eliminate the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).\\n2. At low levels of LDL-C, there is meaningful residual risk of ASCVD attributed to non-LDL and non-ApoB risk factors.\\n3. Additional risk factors of ASCVD include insulin resistance, hypertension, obesity, elevated triglycerides, which are the primary components of Metabolic Syndrome.\\n4. Several of these additional risk factors appear to be stronger predictors of premature cardiovascular disease than elevated LDL-C/ApoB.\\n5. Importantly, insulin resistance, hypertension, and elevated triglycerides also appear to be independent risk factors of several non-ASCVD diseases, including numerous cancers, dementia, infertility, kidney disease, liver disease, depression, and more.\\n6. Meanwhile, elevated LDL-C and ApoB are primarily recognized as risk factors of ASCVD alone.\\n7. While ASCVD is the single leading cause of death among adult men and women 65+ years old, it still represents a minority of overall mortality, with cancer representing the largest cause of death in younger adults ages 45-64 years old.\\n8. Therefore, individuals seeking to extend lifespan through the reduction of ASCVD and non-ASCVD diseases should seek to optimize risk factors of Metabolic Syndrome in addition to LDL-C and ApoB.\\n9. While many recommend limiting the consumption of dietary saturated fat for the sake of lowering LDL-C/ApoB, this dietary intervention has no meaningful impact on improving insulin resistance, hypertension, triglycerides, or the incidence of cancer.\\n10. While it is advisable to avoid the excess consumption of highly refined carbohydrates including sucrose and fructose, high quality clinical trials have demonstrated measurable and rapid improvements in Metabolic Syndrome and LDL-C by replacing highly processed carbohydrates with higher quality starches. Notably, these health benefits can be achieved without a reduction in calories or a reduction in carbohydrates consumed, but rather, an improved quality of carbohydrates consumed.\\n\\n**The Benefits and Limitations of Aggressive LDL-C Lowering**\\n\\nAmong individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease, elevated LDL-C and ApoB are recognized as causal risk factors for ASCVD. Additionally, the reduction of LDL-C/ApoB with lipid lowering therapy, primarily through statin therapy has resulted in reduced rates of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. With new and emerging classes of lipid lowering therapy (Ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, Bempedoic acid, Inclisiran, etc), meaningful improvements in the ability to achieve progressively lower levels of LDL-C has been achieved. Notably, with lower levels of LDL-C, further reductions in ASCVD have been demonstrated. Meanwhile, very low levels of LDL-C and ApoB have not eliminated the risk of ASCVD. To demonstrate this, the results of several landmark clinical trials will be reviewed.\\n\\n**Intensive Lipid Lowering with High-Dose Atorvastatin**\\n\\nIn a large clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness and safety of varying doses in statin therapy, more than 10,000 patients with known coronary atherosclerosis were randomized to receive either 10mg or 80mg of Atorvastatin.1 After follow-up of nearly 5 years, average LDL-C levels were 101 mg/dL for patients receiving 10mg of Atorvastatin, and 77mg/dL for patients receiving 80 mg of Atorvastatin. Heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death occurred in 10.9% of patients receiving low-dose Atorvastatin, and 8.7% of patients receiving high-dose Atorvastatin. There was no difference in overall life expectancy between the two groups.\\n\\n**AtorvastatinAverage** **LDL-C Achieved**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n|**Atorvastatin**|**Average** **LDL-C Achieved**|**Heart Attack, Stroke,** **or Cardiovascular Death**|**Lifespan Improved**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|10mg|101 mg/dL|10.9%|\\\\-|\\n|80mg|77 mg/dL|8.7%|No|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Intensive Lipid Lowering Ezetimibe Added to Statin Therapy**\\n\\nTo test the effectiveness of a non-statin therapy, a trial enrolled more than 18,000 patients who were randomized to receive Simvastatin and Ezetimibe or Simvastatin and placebo.2 After an average follow-up of 7-years, an average LDL-C level of 53.7 mg/dL was achieved in the Simvastatin–Ezetimibe group, as compared with 69.5 mg/dL in the Simvastatin–placebo group. Heart attack, stroke, or cardiac death occurred in 32.7% in the Simvastatin–Ezetimibe group, as compared with 34.7% in the Simvastatin–placebo group. There was no difference in overall life expectancy or cardiovascular mortality.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n||**Average** **LDL-C Achieved**|**Heart Attack, Stroke,** **Cardiac Death or Event**|**Lifespan Improved**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Simvastatin + Placebo|69.5 mg/dL|34.7%|\\\\-|\\n|Simvastatin + Ezetimibe|53.7 mg/dL|32.7%|No|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Intensive Lipid Lowering With PCSK9-Inhibitor Added to Statin Therapy**\\n\\nWith the emergence of PCSK9-inhibitor therapies, a separate trial enrolled more than 27,000 patients with cardiovascular disease to receive either Evolocumab and statin, or statin therapy and placebo.3 At the end of the trial, an average LDL-C of 30 mg/dL was achieved in the Evolocumab-statin group, and 92 mg/dL in the statin-placebo group. Heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death occurred in 9.8% of patients receiving Evolocumab and statin, and 11.3% receiving statin therapy and placebo. Again, there was no difference in overall life expectancy or cardiovascular mortality.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n||**Average** **LDL-C Achieved**|**Heart Attack, Stroke,** **Cardiac Death or Event**|**Lifespan Improved**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Statin + Placebo|92 mg/dL|11.3%|\\\\-|\\n|Statin + Evolocumab|30 mg/dL|9.8%|No|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Residual Risk of ASCVD With Optimal Levels of LDL-C**\\n\\nAs demonstrated above, achieving very low levels of LDL-C reduces cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke. Importantly, however, significant residual risk of ASCVD exists even among those with optimal levels of LDL-C as low as 30 mg/dL. In other words, the risk of cardiovascular disease is not eliminated with very low levels of LDL-C, highlighting the risk associated with non-LDL-C and ApoB risk factors.\\n\\nMoreover, among the patients tested in these three separate trials, the use of high-dose Atorvastatin, Ezetimibe, and Evolovumab failed to improve lifespan. It can, however, be argued that healthspan was improved as a result of fewer cardiovascular events and hospitalization.\\n\\n**Searching For Residual Risk**\\n\\nTo identify additional cardiovascular risk factors other than LDL-C/ApoB, it is helpful to examine the results of a large prospective cohort study that enrolled more than 28,000 women without pre-existing heart disease, and spanned a timeframe of 21.4 years.4 In this study, diabetes and insulin resistance were the strongest risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease at any age. The heightened risk of insulin resistance and Metabolic Syndrome were followed by the risk of hypertension, obesity, and tobacco use. Elevated levels of triglycerides were a stronger predictor of cardiovascular disease at all ages than elevated ApoB and non-HDL. Elevated LDL-C was the weakest predictor of cardiovascular disease among all values typically obtained on a routine lipid panel.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n|**Risk Factor**|**Heart Disease Hazard Ration, Age < 55 Years**|**Heart Disease Hazard Ration, Age 65+ Years**|\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|Diabetes|10.71|4.49|\\n|Metabolic Syndrome|6.09|2.82|\\n|Hypertension|4.58|2.06|\\n|Obesity|4.33|2.14|\\n|Tobacco Use|3.92|1.89|\\n|Systolic BP, per SD increment|2.24|1.48|\\n|Family History|2.19|1.60|\\n|Triglycerides, per SD increment|2.14|1.61|\\n|ApoB, per SD increment|1.89|1.52|\\n|Non-HDL, per SD increment|1.67|1.41|\\n|LDL-C, per SD increment|1.38|1.24|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Justification For Optimizing Additional Risk Factors**\\n\\nLarge-scale clinical trials have repeatedly and convincingly achieved meaningful reductions in cardiovascular events through the treatment of insulin resistance, high blood pressure, body weight, and the cessation of tobacco use. In prospective cohort studies, improvements in the risk factors associated with Metabolic Syndrome have demonstrated reduced cardiovascular events, while the development of Metabolic Syndrome has demonstrated increased cardiovascular events.\\n\\nOver the past decade, increasing attention has been placed on elevated triglycerides as an independent and treatable risk-factor for ASCVD. In the PROVE IT-TIMI 22 trial, 4,162 patients hospitalized for heart attack were randomized to Atorvastatin 80 mg or Pravastatin 40 mg daily.5 Recurrent heart attack and cardiac death were lowest among patients with an LDL-C less than 70 mg/dL and a triglyceride level below 150 mg/dL. Increased rates of cardiac events were observed in those with triglyceride levels above 150 mg/dL, even when LDL-C was below 70 mg/dL. For each 10-mg/dL decrease in triglycerides, the incidence of a cardiac event was reduced by 1.4% after adjustment for LDL-C and non-HDL-C. This evidence suggests increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular disease attributed to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, in addition to that of ApoB particle number. This, however, remains an active area of research.\\n\\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of triglyceride-lowering therapy in at-risk individuals with optimally controlled LDL-C levels, REDUCE-IT was a multicenter, randomized controlled trial that enrolled 8179 patients to receive statin therapy and icosapent ethyl, or statin therapy and placebo.6 At the time of enrollment, all patients had a measured serum LDL-C below 100 mg/dL and a fasting triglyceride level greater than 135 mg/dL. After an average follow-up of nearly 5 years, heart attack, stroke, a cardiovascular event or cardiovascular death occurred in 17.2% of patients in the icosapent ethyl group, compared with 22.0% in the placebo group. Icosapent ethyl is now FDA-approved the cardiovascular disease prevention in patients with elevated triglycerides and pre-existing heart disease and/or diabetes.\\n\\n**The Impact of Metabolic Syndrome Beyond Cardiovascular Disease**\\n\\nWhile it can be argued that Metabolic Syndrome and its individual components are stronger risk factors for premature cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease at any age, it is even more apparent that Metabolic Syndrome contributes to a much wider spectrum of illnesses than elevated LDL-C/ApoB, extending far beyond that of atherosclerosis. This appears particularly important for young individuals who are experiencing increasing rates of cancer at younger ages, for which a clear explanation has not been identified. \\u200b\\u200b\\n\\nRegarding the negative health impacts of insulin resistance, there is a growing body of evidence identifying persistently elevated levels of insulin (hyperinsulinemia) as a risk factor associated with certain cancers in genetically susceptible individuals.7 This is particularly apparent in several gastrointestinal malignancies, including gastric cancer, hepatobiliary cancer, pancreatic cancer, and possibly colon cancer. Several studies have explored the link between hyperinsulinemia and cancer development, including insulin’s ability to promote cell proliferation and inhibit programmed cell death through the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathway.\\n\\nSeparately, hyperinsulinemia contributes to inflammation throughout the body and blood vessels, heightening the risk of blood vessel injury and thrombosis (blood clot). Mendellian randomization has identified elevated levels of triglyceride-rich containing lipoproteins as a causal risk factor of increased inflammation and elevated C-reactive protein, which is not observed with elevated levels of LDL-C.8\\n\\nCollectively, insulin resistance and individual components of Metabolic Syndrome contribute to a wide spectrum of illness detailed below.\\n\\n**Components of Metabolic Syndrome**\\n\\n|1. Insulin Resistance|2. Visceral Adiposity|3. Hypertension|\\n|:-|:-|:-|\\n|4. Elevated Triglycerides|5. Low HDL Cholesterol||\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Diseases Associated With Metabolic Syndrome**\\n\\n|Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke|10+ Cancers and Inflammation|\\n|:-|:-|\\n|Other Diseases of Atherosclerosis|Infertility, Low Testosterone, PCOS|\\n|Dementia and Vascular Dementia|Pre-Eclampsia and Pregnancy Loss|\\n|Kidney Disease and Liver Disease|Infection, Heartburn, Arthritis, Gout|\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**ASCVD Accounts for A Minority of Deaths Among Adults and Young Adults**\\n\\nAgain, while atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease are the number one cause of death in adults, as of 2020, cardiovascular disease was responsible for less than 28% of all deaths in men and women ages 65 and older in the United States.9 In other words, among all deaths in adult men and women, more than 70% were due to illness other than cardiovascular disease and stroke, for which the optimization of LDL-C will likely have no benefit. When looking at younger individuals ages 45-64 years old who died prematurely, less than 23% of deaths were attributed to heart disease or stroke. Rather, cancer is the number one cause of death in this age group\\n\\nCollectively, the observations highlight the importance of optimizing comprehensive metabolic health, with particular attention to the individual components of metabolic syndrome, which is in addition to LDL-C/ApoB for the sake of cardiovascular risk reduction.\\n\\n**Dietary Recommendations**\\n\\nWhile many recommend limiting the consumption of dietary saturated fat for the sake of lowering LDL-C/ApoB, this dietary intervention does not lead to improvements in insulin resistance, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, or the incidence of cancer.10 In randomized trials of at least a 12-month duration, Mediterranean and low-carbohydrate diets have demonstrated more favorable improvements in weight loss, insulin resistance, and triglycerides compared to low-fat diets, which are currently recommended by the World Health Organization.11-13\\n\\nImportantly, randomized trials have also demonstrated that dietary restriction of refined sugars alone, namely sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup, with isocaloric substitution of complex carbohydrates results in appreciable reductions in body weight, insulin resistance, blood pressure, LDL-C, and triglycerides, independent of caloric intake and carbohydrate intake.14,15 Excessive alcohol consumption is also recognized as a modifiable dietary lifestyle risk factor associated with elevated serum triglycerides and poor health outcome.16,17 Therefore, in addition to promoting weight loss and regular physical exercise, healthcare professional and health conscious individuals should seek to minimize or eliminate the consumption of added and refined sugars, highly processed foods, and excessive alcohol consumption.\\n\\n**Cardiorespiratory Fitness**\\n\\nIn addition to the negative health impacts of all risk factors previously discussed, cardiorespiratory fitness appears to be a stronger predictor of death and disease than obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cholesterol abnormalities. In other words, our physical fitness, or lack thereof, is the strongest predictor of longevity, health, and wellness. Therefore, for optimal risk reduction of preventable medical illness, it is important to optimize both cardiorespiratory fitness and metabolic health.\\n\\n**References**\\n\\nSee below in comments.', 'subreddit': 'Cholesterol', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rae2', 'score': 61, 'upvotes': 65, 'num_comments': 85, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/19bbxbg/the_residual_risk_of_death_and_disease_among/', 'date': '2024-01-20', 'comments': [{'id': 'kiqlyqy', 'name': 't1_kiqlyqy', 'parent_id': 't3_19bbxbg', 'link_id': 't3_19bbxbg', 'text': 'The TLDR here is: High LDL / ApoB are not the only potential risks for cardiovascular disease and exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, managing blood pressure, not smoking, consuming as little alcohol as you can, having regular physicals (to check for afib, etc) - among other things - are all factors. \\n\\nAs this isn’t a cardiovascular disease sub, we do tend to focus just on the subject of the sub.

Metabolic syndrome is literally defined as the presence of multiple risk factors.\\n\\nThe other big problem is the fact that it is lumping incremental risk factors together with non-incremental ones. Diabetes, obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome aren\\'t incremental but instead binary, one either has them or not. However, the study expresses non HDL-cholesterol and apoB as increments in risk per standard deviation increase of the blood marker. \\n\\nTherefore, and crucially, these numbers express different concepts and it\\'s honestly unsound to treat them as directly comparable. \\n\\nFor example, if instead of simply looking at presence (yes/no) of hypertension one considers the risk per standard deviation of systolic blood pressure, the hazard ratio seen is much more similar to that of a standard deviation of apoB (2.24 for those <55 years and then 1.48 and 1.38 for the 65 to 75 and >75 age groups). And the 4.33 HR for \"obesity\" turns into 1.47 per SD increment of BMI!', 'author': 'Bojarow', 'score': 2, 'date': '2024-01-21'}, {'type': 'comment', 'id': 'kish3av', 'name': 't1_kish3av', 'parent_id': 't3_19bbxbg', 'link_id': 't3_19bbxbg', 'text': 'I do not disagree with the general idea that CVD is multifactorial and factors outside of LDL/Apo B matter.  [See reference here with particular emphasis on the main graphic](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/24/2313/5735221).\\n\\nSerious question - why did you not mention Mendelian randomization studies pertaining to LDL, considered one of the strongest lines of evidence establishing lifelong risk between LDL and CVD, but did mention it in the context of triglycerides with inflammation/CRP?\\n\\n[Example](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26780009/)\\n\\n> **Summary:** The naturally randomized genetic evidence suggests that LDL-C has a causal and cumulative effect on the risk of CHD, and that the clinical benefit of exposure to lower LDL-C is determined by the absolute magnitude of exposure to lower LDL-C independent of the mechanism by which LDL-C is lowered. \\n\\nFurther, I am concerned you are mixing and matching standards of evidence, i.e. holding some forms of interventions to a higher standard of evidence than others.  For example, you highlight statin trials indicating that, the lower LDL is held in said groups, the fewer events, but without clear impact on mortality over a few years.  As a sidenote on this, as you highlighted yourself, the absolute odds of death in those few years from cardiovascular disease is of course limited, and failure to find differences are generally ascribed to insufficient powering, unless the argument is seriously \"there is a log-linear reduction in risk of cardiovascular events with reduction in LDL but this will never translate to mortality over the longer term.\"\\n\\nBut you also highlight nutritional interventions such as \"low carb,\" which for some reason you put in the same bucket as \"Mediterranean,\" without seemingly applying the same criteria as to its efficacy.  The conflation of these two is confusing to me because, as you yourself pointed out, we actually do have good evidence for Mediterranean diets influencing disease hard endpoints, but to the best of my knowledge, we do *not* have that same evidence in low carb trials.  Out of curiosity, do you have any intervention trials which demonstrate that any \"low carb\" (typically defined as carbohydrate intake <= ~100 grams in the research) diet has any meaningful impact on any disease state hard endpoints, e.g. cardiovascular disease events or mortality?

But I have always been really good at cardiovascular activities - I run and hike a ton and am pretty good at it. Several years ago I had a reading around 300 and was prescribed a statin but completely ignored it because I just needed the bloodwork for school and still kinda felt the invincibility complex in my early 20s. Within the last few months the health bug started catching up to me and I started taking health and activity very seriously - I do intense cardio / HIIT three days a week, strength training three days a week, and have almost completely eliminated sugars and refined carbs from my diet, and try to opt for high protein and healthy fats (olive oil over butter almost always, salmon, nuts, occasional lean cuts of beef, no more than 4 eggs a week). \\n\\nSo when I decided to check bloodwork I was hoping to see a trend down now that I have cleaned up my diet quite a bit. Readings as follows:\\n\\nTotal cholesterol: 427\\n\\nLDL cholesterol: 364\\n\\nHDL cholesterol: 47\\n\\nTriglycerides: 77\\n\\nI am still reeling a bit. I got the results past 8 last night so I haven't heard back from the doctor yet but I am sure I will soon. He already referred me to a cardiologist for a soft heart murmur (he wasn't too worried about it) so I have that scheduled. \\n\\nI think some steps forward are plain as day - there are sources of saturated fats in my diet that I can clean up (I can entirely eliminate beef, pork, fatty pieces of poultry, butter, cheese, and milk - RIP pizza). I can also increase exercise even more. But even if I do all of that and increase cardio activity even more, this number is too absurdly high for me to not be on medication, right? Even if I were able to naturally slash it by 25% it would still be considered dangerous. I was told my dad's cholesterol was higher than mine when he was even younger than me but he has been on statins for a long while, so I will probably have to go on medication. \\n\\nIf anyone who also had such an absurd number has any recommendations as far as diet modifications, medications that worked for them, how to deal with side effects, or just general advice please let me know.

CCTA showed multiple high-risk plaques with signs of plaque inflammation in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and circumflex artery (CX) (*Panel*). During 5\\u2009years of antiretroviral therapy, biomarkers of inflammation (CD4 cells, neopterin) improved significantly: CD4+ cells increased from 4 to 177 cells/µL and neopterin decreased from 82.3\\u2009nmol/L to 10.8\\u2009nmol/L.\\n\\nThe patient was prescribed rosuvastatin 10\\u2009mg, but she did not take the medication, hence LDL-c remained unchanged after 5\\u2009years.\\n\\nAfter 5\\u2009years, coronary calcium score increased mildly from 245.7 Agatston Units (AU) to 381.9\\u2009AU. CCTA revealed an impressive regression of multiple high-risk non-calcified lesions in the mid LAD and the proximal CX and a complete transformation into stable calcified lesions. The perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI) increased from being positive for perivascular oedema (−33 HU) in 2014 to above −70 HU (−86 HU) after 5\\u2009years, indicating reduced cardiovascular risk.\\n\\nWe report full regression of non-calcified ‘high-risk’ plaque by CCTA, which transformed to stable calcified lesions after 5\\u2009years of anti-inflammatory (but not statin) treatment.\\n\\nWhile statins and novel PCSK9^(4)\\xa0inhibitors are known to induce non-calcified fibroatheroma regression, our case shows that not only statins but also anti-inflammatory mechanisms are important drivers of ‘high-risk’ lesions.\\n\\nCCTA allows for monitoring of therapy success in patients with inflammatory ‘high-risk plaque’.\\n\\nCCTA showed mild increase in coronary calcium from 2014 until 2019, with two new calcified nodules in the mid LAD and one in the proximal CX (arrows, right upper panel).

Since joining about a week ago, I have scoured posts about low saturated fat diets, Peter Attia (sp?), Lilly clinical trials, etc. I spoke with my doctor about the following questions and was met with a very haulted response in that I don\\'t pose a threat right now. Basically, the phone conversation I had with her left me with feeling like I\\'m overreacting because I am only 37 and not \"currently\" at risk. I mentioned to her that I have a young child and my mother died young (64, pancreatic cancer) and I am trying to be as proactive (as Kaiser markets themselves and prides themselves as being) as possible. She couldn\\'t get off the phone with me fast enough and was pretty combative with my research based responses, basically saying it without saying it that she was the doctor and this is what they know now. Any advice on the following (doctor\\'s response in parenthesis) is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.\\n\\nStats: 37 year old female, 5\\'2\", 158 lbs, Teacher (active, but not ACTIVE)\\n\\nHere goes:\\n\\n1. Based on my most recent blood test, my cholesterol went from in September 154 to 191 (normal value is <199), my triglycerides went from 76 to 87 (normal value is <149), my HDL went from 48 to 58 (normal value is > 40), my LDL went from 91 to 117 (normal value is <99), my Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein went from 3.3 to 3.2 (normal value is <3.9; so relatively the same), and my cholesterol (non-HDL) went from 106 to 133 (nonHDL targets are 30 mg higher than LDL targets; what does that mean)? Can you determine what happened?\\xa0(She didn\\'t seem to be concerned with this \"spike\" and didn\\'t know what caused it. Thoughts on the above numbers? I did have my thyroid tested test came back normal, so no caused for concern about hypothyroidism)\\n2. I have been pretty diligent with my 10 mg statin and have been religious with my statin since my lipid panel on 6/22. Would you recommend upping my statin or just retesting in a few months? Are there negative reasons for raising a statin? (She doesn\\'t want to raise my statin at this time, because there can be negative risk factors with upping a statin. She said that 10mg is the \"highest\" for low to moderate risk patients, and because there is no family risk, she wanted to stay put at 10mg).\\n3. I am interested in possibly taking Ezetimibe with my statin as combination therapy or a PCSK9 inhibitor like Repatha. Do you recommend any low dose aspirin? (She ordered a lipid panel for October, three months from now, and said she would prescribe me Zetia if I wanted to move forward with that at that time; Thoughts?)\\n4. When is the best time to take my statin\\xa0for maximum absorption? (She mentioned that since I take Crestor, taking it right before bed is best. She said that taking it with a CoQ10 doesn\\'t mess up absorption, but that I should take CoQ10 before a meal and then my statin before bed and I will be fine).\\n5. I am very concerned with my Lipoprotein A results. I know that the normal value is <75 and I was shocked to see that my value is 301. From what I understand, this is a result of genetic high cholesterol and from what I understand, there is currently no medication to lower lipoprotein a levels, but that you need to maintain a low LDL and basically take care of everything else to minimize your risk of strokes, heart attacks, etc. (This is where she got pretty combatative with me and frustrated and explained that is why this test is not normally done because the information just basically becomes an FYI witht much to do with it. I explained to her that I\\'m an information person and basically having a baseline is helpful to me so that I can do everything in my power to control other factors, since I can\\'t do much about this number. She agreed and said that there are many things in the works right now in terms of how to treat LPa (like what is going on with Lilly and that they just don\\'t know how to move forward right now). This is where she got pretty combatative with information and \"being in the know\" such as a doctor and that she realizes that this information isn\\'t readily available to people outside of the medical field, so she forwarded me this information in regards to LPa levels:\\n\\nThere is limited evidence indicating that Lp(a) lowering reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (see \\'Disease associations\\' above). Thus, except in very rare cases, we do not target Lp(a) with any therapy known to lower Lp(a). (See \\'Next steps\\' below.)\\xa0Initial approach — Our initial approach to reducing ASCVD risk in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to its target. (See \"Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease\" and \"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease\".)\\xa0Usually this involves treatment with a statin, with or without ezetimibe. Statins increase Lp(a) levels \\\\[58\\\\]. However, the impact of this increase on cardiovascular events is not known and is felt to be small \\\\[42,59\\\\]. Ezetimibe does not lower Lp(a).\\xa0Some patients who cannot achieve an optimal LDL-C with statin plus ezetimibe are treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor. In the FOURIER trial, Lp(a) reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was associated with ASCVD risk reduction independent of LDL-C lowering, as discussed below \\\\[41\\\\]. Thus, very high-risk patients with high Lp(a) levels may benefit disproportionately from a lipid-lowering strategy that includes a PCSK9 inhibitor. In a post-hoc analysis of ODYSSEY outcomes, participants with LDL-C levels between 55 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL with a Lp(a) level above the median of 13.6 mg/dL had fewer cardiovascular disease events on treatment with alirocumab \\\\[60\\\\].\\xa0Next steps — For patients with elevated Lp(a) who have reached their LDL-C target or who have received all recommended therapies to lower LDL-C, we await definitive evidence from ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials with selective Lp(a)-lowering therapies and do not have any broader recommendations on Lp(a) lowering.\\xa0The use of these therapies in this setting has not been proven in prospectively designed clinical outcome trials. In addition, there are costs to these therapies.\\n\\n6. Do statins raise lipoprotein a levels?\\xa0(She said she didn\\'t know; that there are mixed results in this, but basically I am not a candidate who truly \"can\\'t\" take a statin, so the benefits outweight the costs)\\n\\n7. My goal is to get my LDL below 40 (need to go down 77 points) and keep my HDL above 45. I would like to test my ApoB (that should be in the 40s). How long would it take to get my LDL down to 40-what extreme measures do I need to do?\\xa0(She said that it\\'s possible to get my LDL down as close to 40, but that it is really hard to do and would account for a \"pretty miserable life\" and that she \"wasn\\'t sure how I would feel with an LDL that low\" since our body needs some cholesterol to function. She said that testing for ApoB is mute at this point (in the similar vein to testing for LPa) since it\\'s just FYI information and then what do I do with it if the range is out of normal, when the only current response is to treat with a statin, which I\\'m doing. She said that the \"extreme measure\" I could do at this time is to become plant based with my diet)\\n\\n8. I would like to meet with a cardiologist, and a lipidologist and endocrinologist, if possible. (She didn\\'t respond to the need to meet with a lipidologist or endocrinologist (I\\'m not sure if this is possible through Kaiser), but did put in a referral for a cardiologist, with obvious hesitation, as she thinks the referral will get bounced back. I mentioned that aren\\'t a risk patient due to my numbers, and was met with a similar response that because my risk is currently low, with an assumption that cardiologists are dealing with more severe cases and there isn\\'t much availability. She put in the referral and said that if it gets bounced back, that I would have to go through member services and make an appointment on my own, if it is okayed. \\\\*\\\\*This is where my major frustration is coming from. I don\\'t feel like my situation should be diluted solely based on the severity of what other people are going through. This is apples and oranges and I am trying to be proactive. I wil absolutely be following up with the cardiologist referral and next steps.\"\"\\n\\n9. I would like to schedule a CAC, an APoB test, and an APoA test. Would you recommend that I have a CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) or angiogram to see my plaque levels? I know it may show 0, but wouldn\\'t it be smart to have a baseline? (She said that the CAC is a test she can\\'t put a referral in for, but that the cardiologist would have to do that. She seemed to skate over ordering the APoB and APoa test, but I am sure her response will be that it is just \"more information\" that I just can do nothing about. I plan on asking my hopefully referred cardiologists about all of these tests)\\n\\n10. Should I be paying attention to Hs-CRP (inflammation), LP-PLA2 (enzyme to measure plaque activity), hba1c (blood sugar)?\\xa0(I didn\\'t ask her this question, but was wondering if any of you have any insight on monitoring any of these?)\\n\\n11. I\\'ve also heard that Niacin and/or CoQ10 can be helpful in lowering LDL (and possibly lipoprotein a). I\\'ve started taking 100 mgs of Coq10 and 3 tsps daily of Metamucil as a soluble fiber, since I know both of these things can help with lowering LDL. Should I continue CoQ10 & Metamucil? Would you also recommend taking Niacin and/or Fish Oil or any omegas? Keep with Metamucil or straight psyllium husk? Can psyllium husk affect the absorption of my statins? (She said that taking Niacin with me already being on a statin is not necessary nor recommended, due to the risks that niacin can cause. She said takign CoQ10 is smart since LDL can mess with the CoQ10 levels in our body and taking it as a supplement helps with that. She didn\\'t speak it to possibly lowering my LPa, though. She said taking Metamucil is great and that upping fiber in my diet is really smart. She said that Fish Oil has been pretty controversial and that it is actually showing some signs of being harmful (or not helpful) for people in my situation. She said that Metamucil of straight psyllium husk is fine and that psyllium husk does not affect the absoption of my statins)\\n\\n12. I\\'ve also read that a plant based diet is basically smart for someone in my situation. Would you recommend that I become a vegetarian, as well as avoiding cheese and eggs? Or just a low-carb diet? Should I be avoiding alcohol entirely? What is the recommended % of saturated fats that I should be staying under daily-less than 10mg?? Effects of coffee? Should I be intermittent fasting? I know that diet and exercise won\\'t affect the lipoprotein a, but it seems like I might need an extreme lifestyle change to really get my bad cholesterol levels as low as possible to help combat the lipoprotein a levels I can\\'t do much about. (She confirmed that if my goal is lower my rish of cardiovascular disease as much as possible, that switching to a plant-based diet and avoiding as much animal biproducts as possible is a must. She recommended avoiding cheed and eggs, but didn\\'t mention anything about going low carb. In terms of alcohol, she laughed in the fact that, \"Samantha! You\\'re 37 years old! You can have a drink two a party and not worry about it!\" basically contributing to the notion that she \"said it without saying it\" that I am overreacting, and I really do not feel like I am. She confirmed that getting daily saturated fats down to 10mg a day is ideal, but really hard to do and that the best way to keep it as low as possible is with going plant based. She said that coffee is good for you and that it\\'s what we put in coffee that messes things up. I told her I have my coffee with stevia drops and oatmilk and she said that is fine. She said that intermittent fasting is controversial and that she would not recommend.)\\n\\n13. Are there any clinical trials available for people with my similar results? (She said that she is sure there are clinical trials but that she was unaware of them and it isn\\'t her wheelhouse or recommendation).\\n\\nWHEW! So, that is a summary sentence of the phone conversation. I am left with an action plan of: 1) another lipid panel in October 2024 2) keeping my statin at 10mg 3) going plant based in my diet 4) put in a refferal for a cardiologist. I feel like \"switching doctors\" within Kaiser will just provide me with another doctor in the network with the same response.

First, to directly answer your question, no there is no direct correlation between CAC score increase and blockage. There are mechanistic reasons for this, such as that blockages are caused by a combination of calcified plaque (what shows up in CAC) and soft plaque (what your CTA picked up on). But also just logically, the CAC scale is not 0 - 100. It is goes well over 1000 and to my knowledge I don't think there's an upper limit, so there's no way that it could be a 1:1 direct correlation or people walking around with CAC scores of 1000 would have a 1000% blockage.  \\n\\n\\nThe other thing I wanted to reassure you about is that your CAC score going up after using statins for the first time is both expected and probably beneficial. One positive side effect of statins is that they tend to stabilize existing soft plaque. We prefer calcified plaque because it is less likely to rupture and lead to coronary events. Also, if you're having statin intolerance issues and you can document it through trying several statins, you might be able to get your insurance to cover a PCSK9i, which would do even more to reduce your ApoB/LDL, but is prohibitively expensive without insurance coverage.   \\n\\n\\nHope that helps!\", 'author': 'Rincewind4281', 'score': 7, 'date': '2024-04-02', 'replies': [{'id': 'kxp7c4t', 'name': 't1_kxp7c4t', 'parent_id': 't1_kxonne0', 'link_id': 't3_1btu8jw', 'text': \"You seem knowledgeable.

First, to directly answer your question, no there is no direct correlation between CAC score increase and blockage. There are mechanistic reasons for this, such as that blockages are caused by a combination of calcified plaque (what shows up in CAC) and soft plaque (what your CTA picked up on). But also just logically, the CAC scale is not 0 - 100. It is goes well over 1000 and to my knowledge I don't think there's an upper limit, so there's no way that it could be a 1:1 direct correlation or people walking around with CAC scores of 1000 would have a 1000% blockage.  \\n\\n\\nThe other thing I wanted to reassure you about is that your CAC score going up after using statins for the first time is both expected and probably beneficial. One positive side effect of statins is that they tend to stabilize existing soft plaque. We prefer calcified plaque because it is less likely to rupture and lead to coronary events. Also, if you're having statin intolerance issues and you can document it through trying several statins, you might be able to get your insurance to cover a PCSK9i, which would do even more to reduce your ApoB/LDL, but is prohibitively expensive without insurance coverage.   \\n\\n\\nHope that helps!\", 'author': 'Rincewind4281', 'score': 7, 'date': '2024-04-02', 'replies': [{'id': 'kxp7c4t', 'name': 't1_kxp7c4t', 'parent_id': 't1_kxonne0', 'link_id': 't3_1btu8jw', 'text': \"You seem knowledgeable.

First time poster here. I started eating a high fat diet back in 2021 and lost a bunch of weight. Felt much better. The weight loss stopped after about 20 pounds and I visited my doctor and saw that my total cholesterol had skyrocketed to 480 and over 350 on LDL. But my triglycerides were lower and HDL while not record breaking had gone from probably the 40s to higher 50s. This was January 2022. Doctor tried to convince me to go on a statin at that time and I resisted. I resisted in 2022 and resisted again in 2023. I had put carbs and alcohol back in my diet in 2023 and was eating more like a standard American diet than a keto one, for sure, though never went back to processed food, avoided seed oils. I liked the way I was eating, the way I was feeling. I did put on probably another five or so pounds and didn’t like that. Fast forward to May 2024: My weight was uncomfortably up so I cut alcohol completely and went to a strict keto diet with a calorie deficit of about 1300 cal a day, also mostly doing one meal a day. I use ketomojo and could see that I was in nutritional ketosis for a few weeks. Lost the extra weight and was happy for that. I had my annual exam at the end of this past July and my cholesterol had skyrocketed once again. I finally relented and went on the statin. Started Lipitor (atorvastatin) August 1, 2024. Yesterday, October 8, 2024, I had my blood retaken, and here are my lipid panel results:\\n\\n- Total cholesterol went from 445 on July 23, 2024 to 279, a decrease of 37% since starting the statin on August 1, 2024\\n- LDL went down 177 points from 375 to 198, a decrease of 47% in the same roughly two month period\\n- Triglycerides are down 15 points from 129 to now 114, a decrease of 12%\\n- HDL is up three points from 53 to now 56, an increase of 6%\\n\\nI’m curious what this group thinks of these obvious improvements. \\n\\nI would also like to share some hepatic panel results for the same time period (since  starting the statin on August 1, 2024 and having blood drawn yesterday, October 8, 2024):\\n\\n- ALT went from 22 U/L to 55 U/L, well above the high end of the normal range of 29 U/L\\n- Alkaline phosphatase went from 40 U/L to 88 U/L. \\n\\nI have an appointment with my doctor for next Tuesday to go over these results.

I met with my ARNP yesterday for an annual wellness exam, and was careful to time my latest lipid panel so the results would be available when we met.  Sharing the version-over-version, but the prior test is almost two years old so very difficult to attribute specific recent actions to the changes. **I'd specifically love any feedback on the decision I made with her yesterday, and any recommendations for quesitons/topics for my next follow up or whether to seek a second opinion.**\\n\\n**Where we landed:**  I am not yet starting a statin, though it is obvious that I will need to be on one at some point. She presented me the option, but she also pointed out that after starting statin therapy their system won't order CAC testing because of the calcifying impacts statins have on existing plaques. I said I'd prefer to get this tested first so I understand my baseline, but that once we understand this I'd like to work on my other (non Lp(a)) risk factors aggressively. The rationale being that if I want to wait to ascertain my risk levels more holistically, it's ultimately not going to be 8 more weeks of foregone treatment that cause a MACE, especially when I'm actively intervening with lifestyle changes.  **Does this seem like a reasonable approach knowing I'm likely to seek drug therapy in the next 8-12 weeks?**\\n\\n**Other points from our discussion**:\\n\\n* **PCSK9 Inhibitors:**  I asked if I were prepared to pay for the treatment would this be an option.  She said not likely through the University of Washington, because their lipid center would not even be defaulting to putting me on statins yet.  They would proactively suggest it if my LDL was over 190.  I told her this seemed crazy to me and shared Dr Peter Attia's smoking analogy on this one.  She didn't disagree, but I also have the sense that she's nearly constantly responding to Peter Attia quotes lol.\\n* **Mixed Dyslipidemia**:  My updated diagnosis yesterday was mixed dyslipidemia, because she suspects I may have FH.  This again surprised me given that the recommendations were not more aggressive.\\n\\n**What I'm doing in the meantime:** In summary, I've made a lot of positive changes, but all fall within modest, completely sustainable territory, so I have room to be more aggressive.\\n\\n* **Completely eliminated alcohol:** I think this has been the main driver of triglyceride improvement, but also an easy source for calorie reduction and just too many other relevant risk factors for me to want to maintain.  I may entertain a few glasses of wine around Thanksgiving or Christmas, but for now I've committed to just absolutely none for the next 6-12 months.\\n* **Meal Swapping:**  I used to completely not monitor saturated fat, and paid only minimal attention to fiber intake.  Over the past \\\\~2 months I've essentially been swapping my normal, undisciplined meals, for mostly vegan meals that are very low in sat-fat and very high in fiber.  On the days I monitor, I'm landing around 10-20g sat fat, and 40-50g fiber. For saturated fat, I would say on the days I'm most actively monitoring, I'm generally closer to 10g, but my discipline has often waned over the weekends so would suggest an average in the 10-20g range vs closer to 10g.\\n\\n**What additional follow ups would you bring after receiving CAC scores?  And would you seek a more specialized evaluation?  I've loved the UW system for just about everything, but I'm wondering if I'm running into a downside of a university system in them thinking about this like a public health problem vs an optimal for me problem.

Some topics that I personally found interesting are listed below (NB: I don't agree with some of the points).\\n\\n1. LEM is a mechanism, not a clinical tool. It's a proposed explanation of what is going on with the LMHR phenotype. It's not a recommendation to avoid lipid-lowering or a declaration that LMHR's have good long-term outcomes. ETA: the latter hasn't yet been tested.\\n2. LMHR as a “unique” phenotype - Norwitz kept saying this and I actually disagree with that characterization, especially given that both he and Hill were postulating that the lipid-energy model hypothesis could be a normal physiological response supporting survival during food scarcity. It's not like this phenotype suddenly evolved or there was a genetic mutation in recent years. Unusual given today's energy-abundance and epidemic of overweight - yes. Unique - not so much.\\n3. Physicians should understand what the patient is trying to optimize for. It's important to note that Norwitz has off-the-charts levels of LDLC and Apo B (they can't even measure the latter, it's so high). He says he's not optimizing for Apo B, even understanding there could be long-term CVD risks, because he's trying to stay in remission from chronic IBD (with apparently severe flare-ups of ulcerative colitis) during the remainder of med school. Understanding the horrible time he must have had with this while finishing college and then as a PhD student in England, I still find his reasoning a bit disingenuous and truly wonder if this is the actual reason he's been so prominently pushing for more acceptance of the Keto diet on social media. First of all, he doesn't seem to be familiar with Will Bulsiewicz or any GI doc who might be able to assist him therapeutically in this matter. It sounded like he was self-treating in terms of dietary experiments. Secondly, he's quite risk averse over the long-term when it comes to the idea of lowering his Apo B via a PCSK9i since there's apparently one MR study out there linking the PCSK9 knockout to a higher incidence of dementia. So, he's willing to gamble on CVD but not on dementia? Or he truly doesn't believe he's at greater risk of CVD either? That's my question. I'm surprised Simon Hill didn't call him on this but maybe he will later on. To be fair, Norwitz does a CCTA every few years or so and is due for another one in three years. He says if there's evidence of plaque accumulation then optimizing for Apo B would make sense. Whether that's a wise approach to CVD prevention or not is another matter.\\n4. Apo B is necessary but not sufficient for plaque accumulation, but perhaps it eventually becomes sufficient depending on how high. They were speculating that Dayspring and Bill Cromwell would likely agree that there is some level at which high Apo B itself is sufficient (for instance, an FH situation). However, Norwitz still wants to test the LMHR phenotype specifically in case there's a different, more gentle slope on the road to plaque progression than FH or gen pop.\\n5. My personal favorite: Apo B vs. metabolic vulnerability (currently quantified with the MVX  metric) in non-fatal MACE vs. ACM. This solves that annoying J curve problem that shows how lower LDLC/Apo B might be associated with higher mortality incidence. When you adjust for metabolic vulnerability (an index of various metrics including malnourishment and GlycA) the J curve disappears and there's a monotonic increase with lipid levels. This is why Apo B itself is currently great at predicting incidence and risk of non-fatal MACE but not so good at predicting ACM; there's a lot of noise associated with differential levels of metabolic vulnerability. Cromwell communicated this recently in a series of talks available on youtube (one of them being his address at Co-Sci from this spring). Worth checking out. Unfortunately, while we can get GlycA itself measured (LabCorp, among others, provides this test), MVX isn't quite ready for prime time.\", 'subreddit': 'Cholesterol', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rae2', 'score': 5, 'upvotes': 6, 'num_comments': 10, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1eb9znm/nick_norwitz_on_simon_hill_oreos_keto_lmhr_lipid/', 'date': '2024-07-24', 'comments': [{'id': 'lexl73k', 'name': 't1_lexl73k', 'parent_id': 't3_1eb9znm', 'link_id': 't3_1eb9znm', 'text': 'Thanks for sharing this as I don\\'t plan on watching this thing in full.

At the time I was taking 20mg rosuvastatin. \\n\\nIn March after several months of no statin my doctor did a lipid panel and also recommended a calcium score test to see if I really needed cholesterol meds. Unfortunately there was a positive score of 262 with positive findings in the LAD 156, RCA 106.  However I think I read somewhere on here that prior statin use makes the calcium score test unreliable? Neither my primary care doctor or the cardiologist I was referred to mentioned this, so I'm wondering if there are better tests I should ask about? \\n\\nIn March after being very scared from these findings I started a WFPB diet, and also asked my primary care Dr to try 5mg rosuvastatin to see if I could tolerate that. I'm happy to report a huge improvement in my bloodwork from last week (total cholesterol from 242 to 152, ldl from 173 to 89).\\n\\nUnfortunately even with the 5mg rosuvastatin I'm still having some muscle pains so I think I need to discontinue that.

I'll skip my long story on how mad I am about my doctor not listening to my concerns and not referring me to a cardiologist years ago. \\n\\nThe CAC score is probably not front and center in discussions because a high CAC score only tells what happened in the past. It means that you HAD soft plaque buildup that calcified (and statins do cause plaque to calcify, which stabilizes it, so not all bad).\\xa0It does not indicate whether or not you have soft plaque buildup now, and that’s the killer. People with a CAC of zero have had heart attacks. Invasive testing is the only real way to tell if there is soft plaque buildup now, but unless there are other reasons to test, like angina, they usually don't recommend them first since those tests carry risks. (Additional coronary CT scans will be meaningless, so there is no need to expose yourself to more radiation by repeating the test.)\\xa0\\n\\nIt sounds like you are doing the right things. Good diet, not smoking, etc. I would work with the cardiologist, and ask about an ECG and an echocardiogram. I'd also ask for additional lipids tests like Lp (a), APO B, and a Lipoprotein NMR test. If further tests aren't indicated for you, they should explain why. Push if not satisfied. \\n\\nIt’s too bad you aren’t tolerating the statins because it looks like they produce good results. However, it can take 6 months for dietary changes to fully work, so keep that up as well.  Have they done a CK test to make sure the pain isn’t related to something else? Like overtraining? Have you tried coQ10? I take coQ10 daily as a prophylactic and some people have been able to tolerate statins by adding it.

I'll skip my long story on how mad I am about my doctor not listening to my concerns and not referring me to a cardiologist years ago. \\n\\nThe CAC score is probably not front and center in discussions because a high CAC score only tells what happened in the past. It means that you HAD soft plaque buildup that calcified (and statins do cause plaque to calcify, which stabilizes it, so not all bad).\\xa0It does not indicate whether or not you have soft plaque buildup now, and that’s the killer. People with a CAC of zero have had heart attacks. Invasive testing is the only real way to tell if there is soft plaque buildup now, but unless there are other reasons to test, like angina, they usually don't recommend them first since those tests carry risks. (Additional coronary CT scans will be meaningless, so there is no need to expose yourself to more radiation by repeating the test.)\\xa0\\n\\nIt sounds like you are doing the right things. Good diet, not smoking, etc. I would work with the cardiologist, and ask about an ECG and an echocardiogram. I'd also ask for additional lipids tests like Lp (a), APO B, and a Lipoprotein NMR test. If further tests aren't indicated for you, they should explain why. Push if not satisfied. \\n\\nIt’s too bad you aren’t tolerating the statins because it looks like they produce good results. However, it can take 6 months for dietary changes to fully work, so keep that up as well.  Have they done a CK test to make sure the pain isn’t related to something else? Like overtraining? Have you tried coQ10? I take coQ10 daily as a prophylactic and some people have been able to tolerate statins by adding it.

First the simplistic model that atherosclerosis is simply cholesterol build up in your blood vessels needs to be thrown out of the water. The problem is this model will never go away because atherosclerosis is complex. In addition I don't just mean complex according to Webster's standard definition but also complex in a mathematical way.\\n\\nI'll try to briefly and oversimplify the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis below\\n\\n\\n1.  First understand that LDL is not cholesterol per se. LDL carries cholesterol to your cells. Every single cell in your body requires cholesterol as the cell walls are made of cholesterol. Countless hormones including estrogen and testosterone use cholesterol as a precursor.\\n\\n2.  On the flip side HDL is also a cholesterol carrying particle. It is felt that HDL scavengers extra cholesterol and brings it back to the liver for processing. There's a little bit of uncertainty about this, but let's just go with this understanding for now.\\n3.  So LDL is always providing your body cholesterol, which it needs. However a couple of things can happen.\\n4.  Over time your blood vessel walls (endothelium) can become dysfunctional or inflamed. This allows excess everything including LDL to penetrate the blood vessel walls. Let's start thinking of a couple of scenarios:  what if we have a relatively low number of LDL particles but a very inflamed endothelium. What if we have a very high number of LDL particles but a very healthy endothelium.  This is why a simple mechanistic model is difficult to apply here.\\n5.  Now once the endothelium becomes permeable LDL can sneak across the blood vessel walls. It is felt that the small LDL particles are able to sneak more easily across the blood vessel walls. Here's where some of the trouble happens. LDL may start reacting with the white blood cells that are present in the inflamed and endothelium.  Let's think of scenario:  What if we have a high number of LDL particles that have sneaked across the endothelium but they don't initiate an inflammatory reaction.  What if they don't have the receptors to interact or what if they are blocked from reacting?\\n6.  How does LP(a) fit in?  You can think of LPA as either a specific type of LDL or LDL with a specific protein attached to it. Either way LPA does a lot of things such as make the blood vessels more permeable, recruit inflammatory cells and chemicals, and promote abnormal growth of the blood vessel walls.\\n7.  Once the LDL reacts with the white blood cells a foam cell forms.\\n8.  Concurrently with this a whole set of other inflammatory processes are going including hyper growth of the smooth vessel wall.\\n9.  If this has gone on long enough this may be seen as plaque. And if it continues even longer it's plaque becomes calcified\\n10.  Finally, we have the ..ahem.. final pathway of the disease. I often say that it's not necessarily plaque that kills people it's the rupture of the plaque. And that pathway requires activation of platelets and clotting factors.  Let's think of some scenarios:  What if your body makes plaque, but the cap over the plaque is so stable it never ruptures.  What if, for whatever reason, you never form a blood clot on the plaque if it ever does rupture?\\n11.  So in summary, we have a long non-linear, concurrent, cascade of events. In addition each pathway affects each other in different ways as well as provide different levels of feedback.\\n12.  There are countless different receptors involved so a simplistic model will obviously fail to capture this:  let's say for example we have elevated levels of CIRCULATING LP(a) but we have a therapy that blocks the ability of LP(a) to cross the blood vessel wall?\\n13.  So it makes sense to think of atheroclerosis as a complex process in the mathematical sense. There are specific nodes that are important to the disease process. There are specific nodes that are rate limiting. However it is also important understand that the complex interplay of all the different concurrent pathways may never be completely delineated in a fine way.  Each step of the pathway has multiple receptors, multiple mediators, multiple feedback mechanisms, etc. It is simply not possible to say if you do A, B will happen all the time. Indeed, it's amazing that we even have the understanding that we currently do.\\n14.  Okay let's get back to statins. The most important thing to understand what students is they just don't reduce cholesterol. It is felt that they have multiple other beneficial effects. Statins have been shown to improve endothelial function, they have shown to have antioxidant effects, and they have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. And so it is felt that these additional facts probably outweigh any effect that it may have due to it's effect on LPA levels\\n15.  Most importantly almost every clinical trial shows that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks so regardless of the mechanism they seem to work. Outcomes are the ultimate litmus test\\n\\nI pretty much dictated this on the fly so I've oversimplified a lot of things and they're probably a lot of dictation errors so I'm happy to clarify things\", 'author': 'therationaltroll', 'score': 8, 'date': '2024-06-03', 'replies': [{'id': 'l72f324', 'name': 't1_l72f324', 'parent_id': 't1_l6x5c6y', 'link_id': 't3_1d74qa0', 'text': 'Thank you for this science lesson, I had no idea.

First the simplistic model that atherosclerosis is simply cholesterol build up in your blood vessels needs to be thrown out of the water. The problem is this model will never go away because atherosclerosis is complex. In addition I don't just mean complex according to Webster's standard definition but also complex in a mathematical way.\\n\\nI'll try to briefly and oversimplify the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis below\\n\\n\\n1.  First understand that LDL is not cholesterol per se. LDL carries cholesterol to your cells. Every single cell in your body requires cholesterol as the cell walls are made of cholesterol. Countless hormones including estrogen and testosterone use cholesterol as a precursor.\\n\\n2.  On the flip side HDL is also a cholesterol carrying particle. It is felt that HDL scavengers extra cholesterol and brings it back to the liver for processing. There's a little bit of uncertainty about this, but let's just go with this understanding for now.\\n3.  So LDL is always providing your body cholesterol, which it needs. However a couple of things can happen.\\n4.  Over time your blood vessel walls (endothelium) can become dysfunctional or inflamed. This allows excess everything including LDL to penetrate the blood vessel walls. Let's start thinking of a couple of scenarios:  what if we have a relatively low number of LDL particles but a very inflamed endothelium. What if we have a very high number of LDL particles but a very healthy endothelium.  This is why a simple mechanistic model is difficult to apply here.\\n5.  Now once the endothelium becomes permeable LDL can sneak across the blood vessel walls. It is felt that the small LDL particles are able to sneak more easily across the blood vessel walls. Here's where some of the trouble happens. LDL may start reacting with the white blood cells that are present in the inflamed and endothelium.  Let's think of scenario:  What if we have a high number of LDL particles that have sneaked across the endothelium but they don't initiate an inflammatory reaction.  What if they don't have the receptors to interact or what if they are blocked from reacting?\\n6.  How does LP(a) fit in?  You can think of LPA as either a specific type of LDL or LDL with a specific protein attached to it. Either way LPA does a lot of things such as make the blood vessels more permeable, recruit inflammatory cells and chemicals, and promote abnormal growth of the blood vessel walls.\\n7.  Once the LDL reacts with the white blood cells a foam cell forms.\\n8.  Concurrently with this a whole set of other inflammatory processes are going including hyper growth of the smooth vessel wall.\\n9.  If this has gone on long enough this may be seen as plaque. And if it continues even longer it's plaque becomes calcified\\n10.  Finally, we have the ..ahem.. final pathway of the disease. I often say that it's not necessarily plaque that kills people it's the rupture of the plaque. And that pathway requires activation of platelets and clotting factors.  Let's think of some scenarios:  What if your body makes plaque, but the cap over the plaque is so stable it never ruptures.  What if, for whatever reason, you never form a blood clot on the plaque if it ever does rupture?\\n11.  So in summary, we have a long non-linear, concurrent, cascade of events. In addition each pathway affects each other in different ways as well as provide different levels of feedback.\\n12.  There are countless different receptors involved so a simplistic model will obviously fail to capture this:  let's say for example we have elevated levels of CIRCULATING LP(a) but we have a therapy that blocks the ability of LP(a) to cross the blood vessel wall?\\n13.  So it makes sense to think of atheroclerosis as a complex process in the mathematical sense. There are specific nodes that are important to the disease process. There are specific nodes that are rate limiting. However it is also important understand that the complex interplay of all the different concurrent pathways may never be completely delineated in a fine way.  Each step of the pathway has multiple receptors, multiple mediators, multiple feedback mechanisms, etc. It is simply not possible to say if you do A, B will happen all the time. Indeed, it's amazing that we even have the understanding that we currently do.\\n14.  Okay let's get back to statins. The most important thing to understand what students is they just don't reduce cholesterol. It is felt that they have multiple other beneficial effects. Statins have been shown to improve endothelial function, they have shown to have antioxidant effects, and they have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. And so it is felt that these additional facts probably outweigh any effect that it may have due to it's effect on LPA levels\\n15.  Most importantly almost every clinical trial shows that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks so regardless of the mechanism they seem to work. Outcomes are the ultimate litmus test\\n\\nI pretty much dictated this on the fly so I've oversimplified a lot of things and they're probably a lot of dictation errors so I'm happy to clarify things\", 'author': 'therationaltroll', 'score': 8, 'date': '2024-06-03', 'replies': [{'id': 'l72f324', 'name': 't1_l72f324', 'parent_id': 't1_l6x5c6y', 'link_id': 't3_1d74qa0', 'text': 'Thank you for this science lesson, I had no idea.

There can be all sorts of hidden medical issues. Are you getting a test for C-reactive protein? That is a good one because it often can show up a variety of conditions that cause chronic inflammation, which can then elevate LDL. Did you get ApoB and lp(a) tested? Also it would be relevant to know your total blood panel, like how are your HDL and triglycerides? It's a very different scenario if you have high triglycerides (indicative of insulin resistance) vs. if you do not.\\n\\nWhat is your current diet like?\\n\\nYou might have some invisible foods that are causing a problem.\\n\\nYou also might have some deficiencies or things you could add. Soluble fiber (easiest sources to add are whole fruit, ground flaxseed, chia seed, or psyllium husk) has some of the strongest evidence behind lowering LDL. Also eating a lot of vegetables is important in general.\\n\\nGut health, which you can influence by eating probiotic foods like yogurt, kimchi, and fermented beans, can also be a big factor. Do you currently eat any yogurt? It might be worth adding plain yogurt (even full fat yogurt is usually fine to add because the effect on gut health is usually bigger than any risk of saturated fat and there can be some other benefits to full-fat dairy over nonfat) or kefir which has even more active cultures than yogurt, if you don't already eat them. Gut health is also one thing that you can get tested, and I think people often neglect gut health when looking at heart disease risk. How is your digestion and regularity?\\n\\nDo you take any supplements? I always recommend trying to get things from whole foods rather than supplements if possible. Supplements often have a quality-control issue, for example, omega 3 fats spoil easily and when you pop a pill, you don't taste the oil so it might be rancid. Rancid oil can cause oxidative stress and inflammation, which can actually cause LDL to soar. For omega 3 the best source is fatty fish and other good sources are walnut, flax, chia, or perilla oil, as well as large quantities of cooked green vegetables.\\n\\nAnother completely different medical thing to look at is dental and gum health. Gingivitis (gum disease, reflected by gum inflammation and/or bleeding and/or recessing gums) can cause elevated LDL levels. This is an issue I am prone to genetically and have had to work to keep under control, but it can be kept under control by flossing and using a good electric toothbrush.\\n\\nOther things that you can add in that a lot of people neglect include tea, herbs, and spices. All of these add negligible calories but can have cholesterol-lowering effects that can add up. Although the research hasn't verified that it is necessarily better than other tea types, Chinese traditional medicine says that Pu-erh is best for cholesterol, and it tends to be lower in caffeine so most people can drink a bit more of it than other tea. I drink a lot of black tea though, and pretty much all types of tea have some beneficial effect on cholesterol and total heart disease risk.\\n\\nHerbs and spices can be added to just about any food you make. Ginger and garlic both have some evidence behind them. Many common household spices have some preliminary evidence that they might have some effect, including coriander, paprika, cumin, turmeric, nutmeg, cardamon. Pretty much all spices have at least some preliminary evidence from animal studies that suggest that they *may* have a cholesterol-lowering effect. However none of them have been studied as extensively as drugs. So it's hard to know which of them have the biggest effects or how much, but it certainly can't hurt to try to add more of these things into your diet. If you look at some cultures like India and China and the Middle East, and you look at the quantities of spices and herbs that most Americans and Western Europeans use, you realize that the Western diet is really extraordinarily bland, like people might put just a pinch of something in whereas Indians might be heaping multiple teaspoons or even tablespoons of some spices into a dish. Experiment ramping up your level of certain spices and see how much you can tolerate. Nutritionally, spices are mostly from seeds so they're packed with micronutrients like seeds are. Some like paprika or turmeric, are packed with carotenoids too.\\n\\nYou can also drink herbal teas. There are so many herbs that can be drunk as caffeine-free herbal teas that have some preliminary research suggesting they might be able to lower LDL. These include mulberry leaf, nettle leaf, fenugreek tea, and many others. A lot of these can be safe to drink in large quantities, like nettle leaf is actually usable as a food (as long as you cook it haha...it's a stinging plant!)\\n\\nIf you have LDL being caused by insulin resistance (reflected by high triglycerides on your panel), there are even more herbal teas that address this mechanism, including chamomile, tulsi, and also the spice cinnamon (cinnamon doesn't show evidence of lowering LDL independently of this mechanism though.)

There can be all sorts of hidden medical issues. Are you getting a test for C-reactive protein? That is a good one because it often can show up a variety of conditions that cause chronic inflammation, which can then elevate LDL. Did you get ApoB and lp(a) tested? Also it would be relevant to know your total blood panel, like how are your HDL and triglycerides? It's a very different scenario if you have high triglycerides (indicative of insulin resistance) vs. if you do not.\\n\\nWhat is your current diet like?\\n\\nYou might have some invisible foods that are causing a problem.\\n\\nYou also might have some deficiencies or things you could add. Soluble fiber (easiest sources to add are whole fruit, ground flaxseed, chia seed, or psyllium husk) has some of the strongest evidence behind lowering LDL. Also eating a lot of vegetables is important in general.\\n\\nGut health, which you can influence by eating probiotic foods like yogurt, kimchi, and fermented beans, can also be a big factor. Do you currently eat any yogurt? It might be worth adding plain yogurt (even full fat yogurt is usually fine to add because the effect on gut health is usually bigger than any risk of saturated fat and there can be some other benefits to full-fat dairy over nonfat) or kefir which has even more active cultures than yogurt, if you don't already eat them. Gut health is also one thing that you can get tested, and I think people often neglect gut health when looking at heart disease risk. How is your digestion and regularity?\\n\\nDo you take any supplements? I always recommend trying to get things from whole foods rather than supplements if possible. Supplements often have a quality-control issue, for example, omega 3 fats spoil easily and when you pop a pill, you don't taste the oil so it might be rancid. Rancid oil can cause oxidative stress and inflammation, which can actually cause LDL to soar. For omega 3 the best source is fatty fish and other good sources are walnut, flax, chia, or perilla oil, as well as large quantities of cooked green vegetables.\\n\\nAnother completely different medical thing to look at is dental and gum health. Gingivitis (gum disease, reflected by gum inflammation and/or bleeding and/or recessing gums) can cause elevated LDL levels. This is an issue I am prone to genetically and have had to work to keep under control, but it can be kept under control by flossing and using a good electric toothbrush.\\n\\nOther things that you can add in that a lot of people neglect include tea, herbs, and spices. All of these add negligible calories but can have cholesterol-lowering effects that can add up. Although the research hasn't verified that it is necessarily better than other tea types, Chinese traditional medicine says that Pu-erh is best for cholesterol, and it tends to be lower in caffeine so most people can drink a bit more of it than other tea. I drink a lot of black tea though, and pretty much all types of tea have some beneficial effect on cholesterol and total heart disease risk.\\n\\nHerbs and spices can be added to just about any food you make. Ginger and garlic both have some evidence behind them. Many common household spices have some preliminary evidence that they might have some effect, including coriander, paprika, cumin, turmeric, nutmeg, cardamon. Pretty much all spices have at least some preliminary evidence from animal studies that suggest that they *may* have a cholesterol-lowering effect. However none of them have been studied as extensively as drugs. So it's hard to know which of them have the biggest effects or how much, but it certainly can't hurt to try to add more of these things into your diet. If you look at some cultures like India and China and the Middle East, and you look at the quantities of spices and herbs that most Americans and Western Europeans use, you realize that the Western diet is really extraordinarily bland, like people might put just a pinch of something in whereas Indians might be heaping multiple teaspoons or even tablespoons of some spices into a dish. Experiment ramping up your level of certain spices and see how much you can tolerate. Nutritionally, spices are mostly from seeds so they're packed with micronutrients like seeds are. Some like paprika or turmeric, are packed with carotenoids too.\\n\\nYou can also drink herbal teas. There are so many herbs that can be drunk as caffeine-free herbal teas that have some preliminary research suggesting they might be able to lower LDL. These include mulberry leaf, nettle leaf, fenugreek tea, and many others. A lot of these can be safe to drink in large quantities, like nettle leaf is actually usable as a food (as long as you cook it haha...it's a stinging plant!)\\n\\nIf you have LDL being caused by insulin resistance (reflected by high triglycerides on your panel), there are even more herbal teas that address this mechanism, including chamomile, tulsi, and also the spice cinnamon (cinnamon doesn't show evidence of lowering LDL independently of this mechanism though.) Most of these herbs also act as blood-thinners though so you want to be careful about dosing and avoid taking them in supplement form, instead drinking them as teas, increasing your dose gradually, and listening to your body about how you feel.\\n\\nSo these are all the different angles I can think of right now.\", 'author': 'cazort2', 'score': 10, 'date': '2023-12-05', 'replies': [{'id': 'kc4gpn5', 'name': 't1_kc4gpn5', 'parent_id': 't1_kc42df3', 'link_id': 't3_18bg6s2', 'text': \"Amazing reply!\\n\\n> kefir which has even more active cultures than yogurt, if you don't already eat them.

Exploring the links with metabolic factors can improve health practice.\\n\\n**Methods:**\\n\\nGWAS-meta-analysis of body mass index (BMI) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were performed to summarize the more comprehensive genetic evidence of EAS. Genetic correlation was estimated for pairwise relation across metabolic syndrome (Mets) related traits. Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed to infer the causal associations of Mets’ biomarkers with depression and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Drug target analysis and genetic colocalization focus on lipid-lowering medicine to identify potential treatment adverse effects. Burden assessment analysis was performed to systemically account for depression and CVD by disability adjust life loss (DALY) from LDL lowering.\\n\\n**Results:**\\n\\nA total of 806 and 339 GWAS-independent significant SNPs were identified by GWAS meta-analysis by BMI and SBP, respectively. The genetic correlation matrix showed a high comparable between BBJ and KoGES. MR analysis identified BMI and LDL as potential protective biomarkers for depression and TG as a risky biomarker, without evidence of horizontal pleiotropy, which was supported by sensitivity analysis. The drug-target analysis found lowering LDL via *PCSK9* contributed to a higher risk of depression and genetic colocalization partially supported the same causal variant located at the region of PCSK9 between LDL and depression (PH4/PH3=1·67). Burden assessment analysis supports the benefit of LDL-lowering treatment.\\n\\n**Interpretation:**\\n\\nLower levels of LDL were associated with a higher risk of depression among the EAS ancestry population. Safety assessment of Lipid-lowering treatment, such as PCSK9 inhibitor, should be paid more attention.', 'subreddit': 'ScientificNutrition', 'subreddit_id': 't5_qgptn', 'score': 9, 'upvotes': 10, 'num_comments': 9, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/199dnov/the_divergent_effects_of_ldllowering_and_other/', 'date': '2024-01-17', 'comments': [{'id': 'kif3np3', 'name': 't1_kif3np3', 'parent_id': 't3_199dnov', 'link_id': 't3_199dnov', 'text': '\"MR analysis identified BMI and LDL as potential protective biomarkers for depression and TG as a risky biomarker\"\\n\\n\\nIn which direction was BMI protective?

Anyway, my confusion is why they can\\'t somehow observe this process and monitor it. It\\'s a physical process that occurs in the tubes that carry your blood. Could some advanced technology (like \"nano\" technology?) permit the observation of this process? It seems to me like an odd gap; it doesn\\'t seem like a process like this should be so mysterious. It\\'s not like this process is occurring inside a *cell*, for example; I do recognize that there are billions of things inside a cell and that the cell\\'s interior is a daunting and intimidating and ultra-dense jungle of complication.  \\n\\nI have the same thought about the gastrointestinal system generally. I would give *anything* to be able to go to a lab and get them to put sensors all throughout my GI system. I\\'m constantly wondering about: how quickly nutrients move through my GI system and reach various \"checkpoints\" throughout the system; what the pH is at different points in my GI system; how well nutrients are getting absorbed; and how much inflammation there is throughout my GI system. There is extremely valuable information that everyone would like to know about their GI system. But the system remains (to everyone) a \"black box\". I wonder if there will ever be (for a patient who might have a GI issue) illumination of what\\'s going on in there.\\n\\n* * * \\n\\nEdit: See below on the thing about plaque: \\n\\nhttps://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/41/24/2313/5735221\\n\\n>Extensive evidence on the pathophysiology of ASCVD presented here supplements and extends our earlier review on the causality of LDL based on epidemiological, GWAS, and Mendelian randomization studies, as well as controlled intervention trials with pharmacological agents targeting the LDL receptor. Such evidence, together with the associated molecular mechanisms, has clear implications across the continuum of ASCVD prevention (i.e. primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary) and is consistent with the central concept derived from genomics that the cumulative arterial burden of LDL-C drives the development and progression of ASCVD and its clinical sequelae.\\n\\n>Furthermore, the pathophysiological evidence supports therapeutic strategies aimed at maintaining very low levels of LDL-C (e.g. <1 mmol/L or 40 mg/dL) in patients with established ASCVD at very high risk of recurrent events. Such low plasma LDL-C levels are now attainable with the combination of statins and PCSK9 inhibitors (with or without addition of ezetimibe), therapeutic regimens that have proven safety and tolerability. The unequivocal body of evidence for LDL causality in ASCVD will impact on future international recommendations for the management of atherogenic and ASCVD-promoting dyslipidaemias and will guide the rational use of both existing and new therapies. The success of modern programmes of ASCVD prevention will also rely on the practice of precision medicine and patient-centred approaches.\\n\\n>Finally, this thesis has highlighted emerging mechanistic features of atherosclerosis that can potentially lead to evaluation of new therapeutic targets integral to arterial wall biology and plaque stability. Prominent amongst these are endothelial transcytosis of atherogenic lipoproteins, monocyte/macrophage and SMC biology, efferocytosis, inflammation, innate and adaptive immune responses to the intimal retention of apoB-containing lipoproteins and calcification (Take home figure).

More likely than not, your question has already been answered. Right under the banner, click on the \"Wiki\" tab. For no reason whatsoever, I\\'m just going to make a bunch of posts that can maybe serve as reference later. This is one of those. \\n\\nThis particular post contains everything I know about the effect of diet on blood cholesterol. If you have orthorexic tendencies, just close this tab now. Go do something else. But even if you don\\'t, I imagine that you have a life to live, and your time can be better spent than weighing and measuring every morsel of food and min/maxing to tweak your cholesterol with diet. Just take a statin plus ezetmibe (or add on a PCSK9 inhibitor). Please don\\'t take this as a prescription to do every single thing at once. Just use what\\'s useful to you, to make healthier choices, and leave the rest alone.\\n\\nAlso, a note in terminology. I fully expect someone to parachute down and dispute a fact with me, but refuse to engage in a conversation about how it changes their decision-making, or how it relates to the ongoing discussion. Anyway. There\\'s no lab test called \"LDL.\" On a standard lipid panel, you can have a calculated (or directly measured) LDL cholesterol level. Or you can get an LDL Particle test. (But only get it if you have too much money, or more money than sense.) Or you can get a ApoB test. (If your doctor won\\'t order it, or your insurance is a soulless corporation that doesn\\'t care about your health or life span, or your government doesn\\'t care that you\\'ll pay more taxes the longer you live, pay for it out of your own pocket. But not more than 15-45 dollars USD. Shop around.) Anyway, for the rest of this post, I\\'m using \"LDL\" as a shorthand for \"LDL cholesterol concentration\" *and/or* \"molar concentration of LDL particles\" *and/or* \"ApoB concentration.\" Yes, you\\'re right. They\\'re not the same thing. Each of them is its own thing. They generally move in the same direction, but may be different in an individual. Go ahead. Celebrate your victory. You\\'ve already won. For the purpose of discussion of how diet affects each of those, I\\'m going to treat them as the same. I guess I can\\'t stop you if you still want to fight.\\n\\n**Fats:**\\n\\nAll saturated fatty acids with a chain length greater than 10 increase LDL. Stearic acid is an exception. And the food matrix may have counterintuitive effects. Does that sound like sorcery? I\\'m sorry. Let me try talking about actual foods and the ways you might interact with them.\\n\\nIn general, MCT\\'s won\\'t raise LDL. Most MCT formulations contain either a mixture of caprylic (C8) and capric (C10) acids or pure caprylic (C8) acid. If, for whatever reason, your MCT formulation includes lauric acid, it\\'ll raise your LDL. Check the label. C8 or a mix of C8/C10 *can* raise LDL in individual cases, if you push the dose, i.e. towards 70 grams a day. A tablespoon or two should be fine. Although, they don\\'t lower LDL either. So, consider the opportunity cost.\\n\\nIn the net, coconut flour lowers LDL. Coconut milk and cream aren\\'t as bad as coconut oil. Virgin coconut oil isn\\'t as bad as refined coconut oil.\\n\\nDisregard the lipid impact of fish oil (or marine omega-3). Take them because they\\'re essential nutrients. Or don\\'t take them because you\\'re a contrarian and enjoy putting your health up for wager. I\\'m not the boss of you, IDK. Eat three weekly meals of oily seafood--or not, for other reasons; don\\'t worry about how they affect your lipids.\\n\\nFermented full-fat dairy isn\\'t as bad as fresh whole milk or cream. Fresh whole milk or cream aren\\'t as bad as butter or ghee.  I\\'ll discuss meat in the protein section.\\n\\nIn general, any plant oils that are liquid at room temperature are better than any animal fats. In general, polyunsaturated fats beat monounsaturated fats. \\n\\nCocoa butter has a neutral effect. But most chocolate products lower LDL. Room-temp-liquid plant oils are better than coconut, palm, or animal fats. But is no oil best? In a word, no. The long is answer is noooo! But I\\'ll address it in a separate post of its own. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Protein:**\\n\\nIn general, plant protein beats animal protein. Red meat is worse than poultry, which is worse than fish. In isolation, plant protein tends to lower cholesterol, whereas animal protein raises it; the effect of fats completely overwhelms the impact of proteins, though.\\n\\nThe exception to animal proteins is egg whites. Don\\'t ask me why, but they lower LDL and the effect is stronger than tofu. Yes, egg whites beat a food that\\'s basically a mixture of plant protein, polyunsatured fat, and polyphenols. Homeopathic doses won\\'t do anything do. You need to eat at least 25 grams of protein from eggs whites to get the benefit. That\\'s about a cup of eggs whites, not 25 grams of eggs whites which would be a few teaspoons.\\n\\nAmong plant protein, legume (beans, peas, lentils) proteins have the strongest effect in lowering cholesterol. The pitfall to watch out for are vegan substitute products that use coconut or palm oil. Yes, I\\'m looking at you, Impossible and Beyond Meat. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Carbohydrates:**\\n\\nFor the purpose of trying to lower LDL, fats have the strongest effect on the diet. But since we\\'re here... Intact whole grains, legumes, starchy vegetables, and fresh fruit are better than any powders or liquids.\\n\\nYes, fiber can lower LDL. But the effect is modest. And it\\'s only the sticky, goopy fibers that lower LDL. And even then, you need to push the dose. As in, 20 grams of soluble fiber. You\\'d get that from about 30 grams of psyllium husk powder. If you have too much money, just burn it. Light it on fire. Don\\'t waste it on fiber supplement capsules. By the way, fiber works best when it\\'s spread out throughout the day, i.e. with each meal, and preferably, with each meal containing some fat. And even then, under ideal conditions, it\\'s a 5-10% reduction in LDL-C.\\n\\nClear-mixing fibers like inulin and acacia probably don\\'t have an effect. But you can try it, especially if you push the dose, i.e. towards 30 grams a day or more. Just don\\'t start taking that much right away. Gradually work yourself up to that. Same thing with resistant starch.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Everything Else:**\\n\\nDon\\'t take supplements. If you already take them, stop. If you have more money than you know what to do with, use Google to search for some creative ideas. If you\\'re lucky, your supplement doesn\\'t actually contain what\\'s on the label. If you\\'re unlucky, it\\'s contaminated with heavy metals, pesticides, prescription drugs, unapproved research chemicals, or horse steroids. Even if your supplement contains what\\'s on the label and isn\\'t contaminated, all by itself, it has the potential to stop your heart cold and/or inhibit the breakdown of prescription medications, thereby raising their blood levels.\\n\\nIf you really can\\'t resist the urge, cook with garlic and black cumin (or nigella or black seed). I don\\'t know how much it\\'ll lower your cholesterol, but it\\'s not a substitute for an overall change in diet and lifestyle, and there\\'s a snowball\\'s chance in Hades that it\\'ll replace prescription medication, but at worst, you\\'ll have more delicious food.\\n\\nWhy do you want to pay more for something that has a chance to hurt you and doesn\\'t even work as well as other options available to you?

However, serum levels of TG, HDL-c, and ApoA1 did not show any significant correlation with liver cancer. In the drug target MR (DMR) analyses, HMGCR–mediated level of LDL-c showed an inverse relationship with the risk of liver cancer in the IVW-MR analysis (n = 5 SNPs, OR = 0.201, 95% CI = 0.064 - 0.631; p = 5.95E-03) and SMR analysis (n = 20 SNPs, OR = 0.245, 95% CI = 0.065 - 0.926; p = 0.038) However, PCSK9 did not show any significant association with liver cancer based on both the IVW-MR and SMR analyses.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** \\n\\nOur results demonstrated that reduced levels of LDL-c and TC were associated with an increased risk of liver cancer. Furthermore, lipid-lowering drugs targeting HMGCR such as statins were associated with increased risk of liver cancer.\\n\\n&#x200B;', 'subreddit': 'ScientificNutrition', 'subreddit_id': 't5_qgptn', 'score': 16, 'upvotes': 21, 'num_comments': 2, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/19a5wta/lipids_cholesterols_statins_and_liver_cancer_a/', 'date': '2024-01-18', 'comments': [{'id': 'kikhujp', 'name': 't1_kikhujp', 'parent_id': 't3_19a5wta', 'link_id': 't3_19a5wta', 'text': 'I\\'m seeing all these studies on the risks related to low LDL-c on this sub, meanwhile a lot of \"pro longevity\" folks tend to focus on super low LDL & Apoa1, it\\'s quite hard to understand who\\'s right and wrong.   \\n\\n\\nIf i\\'m looking at this right, there\\'s a sweet spot where you have high HDL, LDL between 130-140?', 'author': 'benwoot', 'score': 5, 'date': '2024-01-19', 'replies': [{'id': 'kikku61', 'name': 't1_kikku61', 'parent_id': 't1_kikhujp', 'link_id': 't3_19a5wta', 'text': \"There's 2 ways of looking at it.\\n\\nFirst there are people who treat Mendelian randomisation like the holy grail, because we don't have quality rcts, they put all their cholesterol-free eggs in that MR basket.

We included 23 studies involving 133\\u2009037 patients (more-intensive LLT: 67\\u2009691 patients and less-intensive LLT: 65\\u2009346 patients). We evaluated 3 types of more- versus less-intensive LLT including more versus less statins (57\\u2009672 patients), combination therapy of ezetimibe versus statins alone (20\\u2009688 patients), or a PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9) inhibitor with statins versus statins alone (54\\u2009677 patients). The odds for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; equivalent to the composite of coronary heart death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary revascularization) were significantly lower in the more-intensive LLT group compared with the less-intensive LLT group in the entire study population (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79–0.88; *P*<0.001), and in all the 3 categories of more-intensive LLT strategies (more-intensive statin therapy: odds ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.76–0.90; *P*<0.001, ezetimibe: odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85–0.96; *P*<0.001, and PCSK9 inhibitors: odds ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.73–0.90; *P*<0.001) with numerically greater relative odds reduction by more-intensive statin therapy and PCSK9 inhibitors than by ezetimibe. Odds reduction for MACE per 20 mg/dL LDL-C reduction was also different across the 3 types of more-intensive LLT (more-intensive statin therapy: 17.4%, ezetimibe: 11.0%, and PCSK9 inhibitors: 6.6%).\\n\\n### Conclusions:\\n\\nIn this meta-analysis, more-intensive LLT as compared with less-intensive LLT was associated with significant odds reduction for MACE in the entire study population and in all the 3 categories of more-intensive LLT such as more-intensive statin therapy, ezetimibe, and PCSK9 inhibitors.

Since joining about a week ago, I have scoured posts about low saturated fat diets, Peter Attia (sp?), Lilly clinical trials, etc. I spoke with my doctor about the following questions and was met with a very haulted response in that I don\\'t pose a threat right now. Basically, the phone conversation I had with her left me with feeling like I\\'m overreacting because I am only 37 and not \"currently\" at risk. I mentioned to her that I have a young child and my mother died young (64, pancreatic cancer) and I am trying to be as proactive (as Kaiser markets themselves and prides themselves as being) as possible. She couldn\\'t get off the phone with me fast enough and was pretty combative with my research based responses, basically saying it without saying it that she was the doctor and this is what they know now. Any advice on the following (doctor\\'s response in parenthesis) is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.\\n\\nStats: 37 year old female, 5\\'2\", 158 lbs, Teacher (active, but not ACTIVE)\\n\\nHere goes:\\n\\n1. Based on my most recent blood test, my cholesterol went from in September 154 to 191 (normal value is <199), my triglycerides went from 76 to 87 (normal value is <149), my HDL went from 48 to 58 (normal value is > 40), my LDL went from 91 to 117 (normal value is <99), my Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein went from 3.3 to 3.2 (normal value is <3.9; so relatively the same), and my cholesterol (non-HDL) went from 106 to 133 (nonHDL targets are 30 mg higher than LDL targets; what does that mean)? Can you determine what happened?\\xa0(She didn\\'t seem to be concerned with this \"spike\" and didn\\'t know what caused it. Thoughts on the above numbers? I did have my thyroid tested test came back normal, so no caused for concern about hypothyroidism)\\n2. I have been pretty diligent with my 10 mg statin and have been religious with my statin since my lipid panel on 6/22. Would you recommend upping my statin or just retesting in a few months? Are there negative reasons for raising a statin? (She doesn\\'t want to raise my statin at this time, because there can be negative risk factors with upping a statin. She said that 10mg is the \"highest\" for low to moderate risk patients, and because there is no family risk, she wanted to stay put at 10mg).\\n3. I am interested in possibly taking Ezetimibe with my statin as combination therapy or a PCSK9 inhibitor like Repatha. Do you recommend any low dose aspirin? (She ordered a lipid panel for October, three months from now, and said she would prescribe me Zetia if I wanted to move forward with that at that time; Thoughts?)\\n4. When is the best time to take my statin\\xa0for maximum absorption? (She mentioned that since I take Crestor, taking it right before bed is best. She said that taking it with a CoQ10 doesn\\'t mess up absorption, but that I should take CoQ10 before a meal and then my statin before bed and I will be fine).\\n5. I am very concerned with my Lipoprotein A results. I know that the normal value is <75 and I was shocked to see that my value is 301. From what I understand, this is a result of genetic high cholesterol and from what I understand, there is currently no medication to lower lipoprotein a levels, but that you need to maintain a low LDL and basically take care of everything else to minimize your risk of strokes, heart attacks, etc. (This is where she got pretty combatative with me and frustrated and explained that is why this test is not normally done because the information just basically becomes an FYI witht much to do with it. I explained to her that I\\'m an information person and basically having a baseline is helpful to me so that I can do everything in my power to control other factors, since I can\\'t do much about this number. She agreed and said that there are many things in the works right now in terms of how to treat LPa (like what is going on with Lilly and that they just don\\'t know how to move forward right now). This is where she got pretty combatative with information and \"being in the know\" such as a doctor and that she realizes that this information isn\\'t readily available to people outside of the medical field, so she forwarded me this information in regards to LPa levels:\\n\\nThere is limited evidence indicating that Lp(a) lowering reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (see \\'Disease associations\\' above). Thus, except in very rare cases, we do not target Lp(a) with any therapy known to lower Lp(a). (See \\'Next steps\\' below.)\\xa0Initial approach — Our initial approach to reducing ASCVD risk in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to its target. (See \"Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease\" and \"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease\".)\\xa0Usually this involves treatment with a statin, with or without ezetimibe. Statins increase Lp(a) levels \\\\[58\\\\]. However, the impact of this increase on cardiovascular events is not known and is felt to be small \\\\[42,59\\\\]. Ezetimibe does not lower Lp(a).\\xa0Some patients who cannot achieve an optimal LDL-C with statin plus ezetimibe are treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor. In the FOURIER trial, Lp(a) reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was associated with ASCVD risk reduction independent of LDL-C lowering, as discussed below \\\\[41\\\\]. Thus, very high-risk patients with high Lp(a) levels may benefit disproportionately from a lipid-lowering strategy that includes a PCSK9 inhibitor. In a post-hoc analysis of ODYSSEY outcomes, participants with LDL-C levels between 55 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL with a Lp(a) level above the median of 13.6 mg/dL had fewer cardiovascular disease events on treatment with alirocumab \\\\[60\\\\].\\xa0Next steps — For patients with elevated Lp(a) who have reached their LDL-C target or who have received all recommended therapies to lower LDL-C, we await definitive evidence from ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials with selective Lp(a)-lowering therapies and do not have any broader recommendations on Lp(a) lowering.\\xa0The use of these therapies in this setting has not been proven in prospectively designed clinical outcome trials. In addition, there are costs to these therapies.\\n\\n6. Do statins raise lipoprotein a levels?\\xa0(She said she didn\\'t know; that there are mixed results in this, but basically I am not a candidate who truly \"can\\'t\" take a statin, so the benefits outweight the costs)\\n\\n7. My goal is to get my LDL below 40 (need to go down 77 points) and keep my HDL above 45. I would like to test my ApoB (that should be in the 40s). How long would it take to get my LDL down to 40-what extreme measures do I need to do?\\xa0(She said that it\\'s possible to get my LDL down as close to 40, but that it is really hard to do and would account for a \"pretty miserable life\" and that she \"wasn\\'t sure how I would feel with an LDL that low\" since our body needs some cholesterol to function. She said that testing for ApoB is mute at this point (in the similar vein to testing for LPa) since it\\'s just FYI information and then what do I do with it if the range is out of normal, when the only current response is to treat with a statin, which I\\'m doing. She said that the \"extreme measure\" I could do at this time is to become plant based with my diet)\\n\\n8. I would like to meet with a cardiologist, and a lipidologist and endocrinologist, if possible. (She didn\\'t respond to the need to meet with a lipidologist or endocrinologist (I\\'m not sure if this is possible through Kaiser), but did put in a referral for a cardiologist, with obvious hesitation, as she thinks the referral will get bounced back. I mentioned that aren\\'t a risk patient due to my numbers, and was met with a similar response that because my risk is currently low, with an assumption that cardiologists are dealing with more severe cases and there isn\\'t much availability. She put in the referral and said that if it gets bounced back, that I would have to go through member services and make an appointment on my own, if it is okayed. \\\\*\\\\*This is where my major frustration is coming from. I don\\'t feel like my situation should be diluted solely based on the severity of what other people are going through. This is apples and oranges and I am trying to be proactive. I wil absolutely be following up with the cardiologist referral and next steps.\"\"\\n\\n9. I would like to schedule a CAC, an APoB test, and an APoA test. Would you recommend that I have a CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) or angiogram to see my plaque levels? I know it may show 0, but wouldn\\'t it be smart to have a baseline? (She said that the CAC is a test she can\\'t put a referral in for, but that the cardiologist would have to do that. She seemed to skate over ordering the APoB and APoa test, but I am sure her response will be that it is just \"more information\" that I just can do nothing about. I plan on asking my hopefully referred cardiologists about all of these tests)\\n\\n10. Should I be paying attention to Hs-CRP (inflammation), LP-PLA2 (enzyme to measure plaque activity), hba1c (blood sugar)?\\xa0(I didn\\'t ask her this question, but was wondering if any of you have any insight on monitoring any of these?)\\n\\n11. I\\'ve also heard that Niacin and/or CoQ10 can be helpful in lowering LDL (and possibly lipoprotein a). I\\'ve started taking 100 mgs of Coq10 and 3 tsps daily of Metamucil as a soluble fiber, since I know both of these things can help with lowering LDL. Should I continue CoQ10 & Metamucil? Would you also recommend taking Niacin and/or Fish Oil or any omegas? Keep with Metamucil or straight psyllium husk? Can psyllium husk affect the absorption of my statins? (She said that taking Niacin with me already being on a statin is not necessary nor recommended, due to the risks that niacin can cause. She said takign CoQ10 is smart since LDL can mess with the CoQ10 levels in our body and taking it as a supplement helps with that. She didn\\'t speak it to possibly lowering my LPa, though. She said taking Metamucil is great and that upping fiber in my diet is really smart. She said that Fish Oil has been pretty controversial and that it is actually showing some signs of being harmful (or not helpful) for people in my situation. She said that Metamucil of straight psyllium husk is fine and that psyllium husk does not affect the absoption of my statins)\\n\\n12. I\\'ve also read that a plant based diet is basically smart for someone in my situation. Would you recommend that I become a vegetarian, as well as avoiding cheese and eggs? Or just a low-carb diet? Should I be avoiding alcohol entirely? What is the recommended % of saturated fats that I should be staying under daily-less than 10mg?? Effects of coffee? Should I be intermittent fasting? I know that diet and exercise won\\'t affect the lipoprotein a, but it seems like I might need an extreme lifestyle change to really get my bad cholesterol levels as low as possible to help combat the lipoprotein a levels I can\\'t do much about. (She confirmed that if my goal is lower my rish of cardiovascular disease as much as possible, that switching to a plant-based diet and avoiding as much animal biproducts as possible is a must. She recommended avoiding cheed and eggs, but didn\\'t mention anything about going low carb. In terms of alcohol, she laughed in the fact that, \"Samantha! You\\'re 37 years old! You can have a drink two a party and not worry about it!\" basically contributing to the notion that she \"said it without saying it\" that I am overreacting, and I really do not feel like I am. She confirmed that getting daily saturated fats down to 10mg a day is ideal, but really hard to do and that the best way to keep it as low as possible is with going plant based. She said that coffee is good for you and that it\\'s what we put in coffee that messes things up. I told her I have my coffee with stevia drops and oatmilk and she said that is fine. She said that intermittent fasting is controversial and that she would not recommend.)\\n\\n13. Are there any clinical trials available for people with my similar results? (She said that she is sure there are clinical trials but that she was unaware of them and it isn\\'t her wheelhouse or recommendation).\\n\\nWHEW! So, that is a summary sentence of the phone conversation. I am left with an action plan of: 1) another lipid panel in October 2024 2) keeping my statin at 10mg 3) going plant based in my diet 4) put in a refferal for a cardiologist. I feel like \"switching doctors\" within Kaiser will just provide me with another doctor in the network with the same response.

Since joining about a week ago, I have scoured posts about low saturated fat diets, Peter Attia (sp?), Lilly clinical trials, etc. I spoke with my doctor about the following questions and was met with a very haulted response in that I don\\'t pose a threat right now. Basically, the phone conversation I had with her left me with feeling like I\\'m overreacting because I am only 37 and not \"currently\" at risk. I mentioned to her that I have a young child and my mother died young (64, pancreatic cancer) and I am trying to be as proactive (as Kaiser markets themselves and prides themselves as being) as possible. She couldn\\'t get off the phone with me fast enough and was pretty combative with my research based responses, basically saying it without saying it that she was the doctor and this is what they know now. Any advice on the following (doctor\\'s response in parenthesis) is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.\\n\\nStats: 37 year old female, 5\\'2\", 158 lbs, Teacher (active, but not ACTIVE)\\n\\nHere goes:\\n\\n1. Based on my most recent blood test, my cholesterol went from in September 154 to 191 (normal value is <199), my triglycerides went from 76 to 87 (normal value is <149), my HDL went from 48 to 58 (normal value is > 40), my LDL went from 91 to 117 (normal value is <99), my Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein went from 3.3 to 3.2 (normal value is <3.9; so relatively the same), and my cholesterol (non-HDL) went from 106 to 133 (nonHDL targets are 30 mg higher than LDL targets; what does that mean)? Can you determine what happened?\\xa0(She didn\\'t seem to be concerned with this \"spike\" and didn\\'t know what caused it. Thoughts on the above numbers? I did have my thyroid tested test came back normal, so no caused for concern about hypothyroidism)\\n2. I have been pretty diligent with my 10 mg statin and have been religious with my statin since my lipid panel on 6/22. Would you recommend upping my statin or just retesting in a few months? Are there negative reasons for raising a statin? (She doesn\\'t want to raise my statin at this time, because there can be negative risk factors with upping a statin. She said that 10mg is the \"highest\" for low to moderate risk patients, and because there is no family risk, she wanted to stay put at 10mg).\\n3. I am interested in possibly taking Ezetimibe with my statin as combination therapy or a PCSK9 inhibitor like Repatha. Do you recommend any low dose aspirin? (She ordered a lipid panel for October, three months from now, and said she would prescribe me Zetia if I wanted to move forward with that at that time; Thoughts?)\\n4. When is the best time to take my statin\\xa0for maximum absorption? (She mentioned that since I take Crestor, taking it right before bed is best. She said that taking it with a CoQ10 doesn\\'t mess up absorption, but that I should take CoQ10 before a meal and then my statin before bed and I will be fine).\\n5. I am very concerned with my Lipoprotein A results. I know that the normal value is <75 and I was shocked to see that my value is 301. From what I understand, this is a result of genetic high cholesterol and from what I understand, there is currently no medication to lower lipoprotein a levels, but that you need to maintain a low LDL and basically take care of everything else to minimize your risk of strokes, heart attacks, etc. (This is where she got pretty combatative with me and frustrated and explained that is why this test is not normally done because the information just basically becomes an FYI witht much to do with it. I explained to her that I\\'m an information person and basically having a baseline is helpful to me so that I can do everything in my power to control other factors, since I can\\'t do much about this number. She agreed and said that there are many things in the works right now in terms of how to treat LPa (like what is going on with Lilly and that they just don\\'t know how to move forward right now). This is where she got pretty combatative with information and \"being in the know\" such as a doctor and that she realizes that this information isn\\'t readily available to people outside of the medical field, so she forwarded me this information in regards to LPa levels:\\n\\nThere is limited evidence indicating that Lp(a) lowering reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (see \\'Disease associations\\' above). Thus, except in very rare cases, we do not target Lp(a) with any therapy known to lower Lp(a). (See \\'Next steps\\' below.)\\xa0Initial approach — Our initial approach to reducing ASCVD risk in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to its target. (See \"Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease\" and \"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease\".)\\xa0Usually this involves treatment with a statin, with or without ezetimibe. Statins increase Lp(a) levels \\\\[58\\\\]. However, the impact of this increase on cardiovascular events is not known and is felt to be small \\\\[42,59\\\\]. Ezetimibe does not lower Lp(a).\\xa0Some patients who cannot achieve an optimal LDL-C with statin plus ezetimibe are treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor. In the FOURIER trial, Lp(a) reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was associated with ASCVD risk reduction independent of LDL-C lowering, as discussed below \\\\[41\\\\]. Thus, very high-risk patients with high Lp(a) levels may benefit disproportionately from a lipid-lowering strategy that includes a PCSK9 inhibitor. In a post-hoc analysis of ODYSSEY outcomes, participants with LDL-C levels between 55 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL with a Lp(a) level above the median of 13.6 mg/dL had fewer cardiovascular disease events on treatment with alirocumab \\\\[60\\\\].\\xa0Next steps — For patients with elevated Lp(a) who have reached their LDL-C target or who have received all recommended therapies to lower LDL-C, we await definitive evidence from ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials with selective Lp(a)-lowering therapies and do not have any broader recommendations on Lp(a) lowering.\\xa0The use of these therapies in this setting has not been proven in prospectively designed clinical outcome trials. In addition, there are costs to these therapies.\\n\\n6. Do statins raise lipoprotein a levels?\\xa0(She said she didn\\'t know; that there are mixed results in this, but basically I am not a candidate who truly \"can\\'t\" take a statin, so the benefits outweight the costs)\\n\\n7. My goal is to get my LDL below 40 (need to go down 77 points) and keep my HDL above 45. I would like to test my ApoB (that should be in the 40s). How long would it take to get my LDL down to 40-what extreme measures do I need to do?\\xa0(She said that it\\'s possible to get my LDL down as close to 40, but that it is really hard to do and would account for a \"pretty miserable life\" and that she \"wasn\\'t sure how I would feel with an LDL that low\" since our body needs some cholesterol to function. She said that testing for ApoB is mute at this point (in the similar vein to testing for LPa) since it\\'s just FYI information and then what do I do with it if the range is out of normal, when the only current response is to treat with a statin, which I\\'m doing. She said that the \"extreme measure\" I could do at this time is to become plant based with my diet)\\n\\n8. I would like to meet with a cardiologist, and a lipidologist and endocrinologist, if possible. (She didn\\'t respond to the need to meet with a lipidologist or endocrinologist (I\\'m not sure if this is possible through Kaiser), but did put in a referral for a cardiologist, with obvious hesitation, as she thinks the referral will get bounced back. I mentioned that aren\\'t a risk patient due to my numbers, and was met with a similar response that because my risk is currently low, with an assumption that cardiologists are dealing with more severe cases and there isn\\'t much availability. She put in the referral and said that if it gets bounced back, that I would have to go through member services and make an appointment on my own, if it is okayed. \\\\*\\\\*This is where my major frustration is coming from. I don\\'t feel like my situation should be diluted solely based on the severity of what other people are going through. This is apples and oranges and I am trying to be proactive. I wil absolutely be following up with the cardiologist referral and next steps.\"\"\\n\\n9. I would like to schedule a CAC, an APoB test, and an APoA test. Would you recommend that I have a CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) or angiogram to see my plaque levels? I know it may show 0, but wouldn\\'t it be smart to have a baseline? (She said that the CAC is a test she can\\'t put a referral in for, but that the cardiologist would have to do that. She seemed to skate over ordering the APoB and APoa test, but I am sure her response will be that it is just \"more information\" that I just can do nothing about. I plan on asking my hopefully referred cardiologists about all of these tests)\\n\\n10. Should I be paying attention to Hs-CRP (inflammation), LP-PLA2 (enzyme to measure plaque activity), hba1c (blood sugar)?\\xa0(I didn\\'t ask her this question, but was wondering if any of you have any insight on monitoring any of these?)\\n\\n11. I\\'ve also heard that Niacin and/or CoQ10 can be helpful in lowering LDL (and possibly lipoprotein a). I\\'ve started taking 100 mgs of Coq10 and 3 tsps daily of Metamucil as a soluble fiber, since I know both of these things can help with lowering LDL. Should I continue CoQ10 & Metamucil? Would you also recommend taking Niacin and/or Fish Oil or any omegas? Keep with Metamucil or straight psyllium husk? Can psyllium husk affect the absorption of my statins? (She said that taking Niacin with me already being on a statin is not necessary nor recommended, due to the risks that niacin can cause. She said takign CoQ10 is smart since LDL can mess with the CoQ10 levels in our body and taking it as a supplement helps with that. She didn\\'t speak it to possibly lowering my LPa, though. She said taking Metamucil is great and that upping fiber in my diet is really smart. She said that Fish Oil has been pretty controversial and that it is actually showing some signs of being harmful (or not helpful) for people in my situation. She said that Metamucil of straight psyllium husk is fine and that psyllium husk does not affect the absoption of my statins)\\n\\n12. I\\'ve also read that a plant based diet is basically smart for someone in my situation. Would you recommend that I become a vegetarian, as well as avoiding cheese and eggs? Or just a low-carb diet? Should I be avoiding alcohol entirely? What is the recommended % of saturated fats that I should be staying under daily-less than 10mg?? Effects of coffee? Should I be intermittent fasting? I know that diet and exercise won\\'t affect the lipoprotein a, but it seems like I might need an extreme lifestyle change to really get my bad cholesterol levels as low as possible to help combat the lipoprotein a levels I can\\'t do much about. (She confirmed that if my goal is lower my rish of cardiovascular disease as much as possible, that switching to a plant-based diet and avoiding as much animal biproducts as possible is a must. She recommended avoiding cheed and eggs, but didn\\'t mention anything about going low carb. In terms of alcohol, she laughed in the fact that, \"Samantha! You\\'re 37 years old! You can have a drink two a party and not worry about it!\" basically contributing to the notion that she \"said it without saying it\" that I am overreacting, and I really do not feel like I am. She confirmed that getting daily saturated fats down to 10mg a day is ideal, but really hard to do and that the best way to keep it as low as possible is with going plant based. She said that coffee is good for you and that it\\'s what we put in coffee that messes things up. I told her I have my coffee with stevia drops and oatmilk and she said that is fine. She said that intermittent fasting is controversial and that she would not recommend.)\\n\\n13. Are there any clinical trials available for people with my similar results? (She said that she is sure there are clinical trials but that she was unaware of them and it isn\\'t her wheelhouse or recommendation).\\n\\nWHEW! So, that is a summary sentence of the phone conversation. I am left with an action plan of: 1) another lipid panel in October 2024 2) keeping my statin at 10mg 3) going plant based in my diet 4) put in a refferal for a cardiologist. I feel like \"switching doctors\" within Kaiser will just provide me with another doctor in the network with the same response. Any other suggestions for me at this time?\\n\\nI\\'ve also been taking down some notes with the beneficial information from this feed.

Go watch some videos that do not spread the cholesterol hypothesis, and instead share something better like the response to injury theory.\\n\\n\\n> the plaque literally starts as young as 10 years old and continues\\n\\nUtter nonsense. Fatty streaks are different from, and not precursors of atherosclerotic plaques. This myth that fatty streaks lead to atherosclerosis is alarmist nonsense, coming from those that profit off the hysteria, or those that did not properly research the disease. https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/19bzo1j/fatty_streaks_are_not_precursors_of/\\n\\n\\n> Ldl of 55 or less is the number if you never want to worry about heart attack.\\n\\nAgain nonsense. Heart disease is response to injury like all chronic diseases, it is a consequence of your artery wall cells being damaged one way or another. Even with hypothetical zero LDL levels, you still get heart disease from smoking, pollution, diabetes, and trans fats. The presentation might be slightly different, but you would still die nonetheless from the damaged arteries. Here is an example thread where this topic was discussed to death: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1eindnr/risk_factors_leading_to_a_heart_attack/\\n\\n\\n> no diet or lifestyle is ever gonna sustain that number \\n\\nThat should have been a dead giveaway that something ain't clapping. Plenty of people avoid heart disease even without fairyland levels of LDL.\\n\\n\\n> unless you are one of the lucky bastards with genetic mutation such as PCSK9 or FHBL who no matter what they eat have low levels of ldl.\\n\\nThose mutations have serious side effects, they are not that lucky as you claim. And again they can still easily get heart disease from the aforementioned risk factors. LDL is not necessary at all for you to wreck your arteries.\\n\\n\\n> There is no other way around it i mean how long can you keep up a life with 40g fiber 10g sat fat the rest of your life?\\n\\nYou do not need to, virtually every healthy diet causes atherosclerosis regression, even low carbohydrate diets that have a tendency to elevate LDL (because of higher lipolysis and VLDL stability).\\n\\nShai, I., Spence, J.

Fatty streaks are different from, and not precursors of atherosclerotic plaques. This myth that fatty streaks lead to atherosclerosis is alarmist nonsense, coming from those that profit off the hysteria, or those that did not properly research the disease. https://www.reddit.com/r/ScientificNutrition/comments/19bzo1j/fatty_streaks_are_not_precursors_of/\\n\\n\\n> Ldl of 55 or less is the number if you never want to worry about heart attack.\\n\\nAgain nonsense. Heart disease is response to injury like all chronic diseases, it is a consequence of your artery wall cells being damaged one way or another. Even with hypothetical zero LDL levels, you still get heart disease from smoking, pollution, diabetes, and trans fats. The presentation might be slightly different, but you would still die nonetheless from the damaged arteries. Here is an example thread where this topic was discussed to death: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1eindnr/risk_factors_leading_to_a_heart_attack/\\n\\n\\n> no diet or lifestyle is ever gonna sustain that number \\n\\nThat should have been a dead giveaway that something ain't clapping. Plenty of people avoid heart disease even without fairyland levels of LDL.\\n\\n\\n> unless you are one of the lucky bastards with genetic mutation such as PCSK9 or FHBL who no matter what they eat have low levels of ldl.\\n\\nThose mutations have serious side effects, they are not that lucky as you claim. And again they can still easily get heart disease from the aforementioned risk factors. LDL is not necessary at all for you to wreck your arteries.\\n\\n\\n> There is no other way around it i mean how long can you keep up a life with 40g fiber 10g sat fat the rest of your life?\\n\\nYou do not need to, virtually every healthy diet causes atherosclerosis regression, even low carbohydrate diets that have a tendency to elevate LDL (because of higher lipolysis and VLDL stability).\\n\\nShai, I., Spence, J.

CCTA showed multiple high-risk plaques with signs of plaque inflammation in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and circumflex artery (CX) (*Panel*). During 5\\u2009years of antiretroviral therapy, biomarkers of inflammation (CD4 cells, neopterin) improved significantly: CD4+ cells increased from 4 to 177 cells/µL and neopterin decreased from 82.3\\u2009nmol/L to 10.8\\u2009nmol/L.\\n\\nThe patient was prescribed rosuvastatin 10\\u2009mg, but she did not take the medication, hence LDL-c remained unchanged after 5\\u2009years.\\n\\nAfter 5\\u2009years, coronary calcium score increased mildly from 245.7 Agatston Units (AU) to 381.9\\u2009AU. CCTA revealed an impressive regression of multiple high-risk non-calcified lesions in the mid LAD and the proximal CX and a complete transformation into stable calcified lesions.

She said not likely through the University of Washington, because their lipid center would not even be defaulting to putting me on statins yet.  They would proactively suggest it if my LDL was over 190.  I told her this seemed crazy to me and shared Dr Peter Attia's smoking analogy on this one.  She didn't disagree, but I also have the sense that she's nearly constantly responding to Peter Attia quotes lol.\\n* **Mixed Dyslipidemia**:  My updated diagnosis yesterday was mixed dyslipidemia, because she suspects I may have FH.  This again surprised me given that the recommendations were not more aggressive.\\n\\n**What I'm doing in the meantime:** In summary, I've made a lot of positive changes, but all fall within modest, completely sustainable territory, so I have room to be more aggressive.\\n\\n* **Completely eliminated alcohol:** I think this has been the main driver of triglyceride improvement, but also an easy source for calorie reduction and just too many other relevant risk factors for me to want to maintain.  I may entertain a few glasses of wine around Thanksgiving or Christmas, but for now I've committed to just absolutely none for the next 6-12 months.\\n* **Meal Swapping:**  I used to completely not monitor saturated fat, and paid only minimal attention to fiber intake.  Over the past \\\\~2 months I've essentially been swapping my normal, undisciplined meals, for mostly vegan meals that are very low in sat-fat and very high in fiber.  On the days I monitor, I'm landing around 10-20g sat fat, and 40-50g fiber. For saturated fat, I would say on the days I'm most actively monitoring, I'm generally closer to 10g, but my discipline has often waned over the weekends so would suggest an average in the 10-20g range vs closer to 10g.\\n\\n**What additional follow ups would you bring after receiving CAC scores?  And would you seek a more specialized evaluation?  I've loved the UW system for just about everything, but I'm wondering if I'm running into a downside of a university system in them thinking about this like a public health problem vs an optimal for me problem.

Some topics that I personally found interesting are listed below (NB: I don't agree with some of the points).\\n\\n1. LEM is a mechanism, not a clinical tool. It's a proposed explanation of what is going on with the LMHR phenotype. It's not a recommendation to avoid lipid-lowering or a declaration that LMHR's have good long-term outcomes. ETA: the latter hasn't yet been tested.\\n2. LMHR as a “unique” phenotype - Norwitz kept saying this and I actually disagree with that characterization, especially given that both he and Hill were postulating that the lipid-energy model hypothesis could be a normal physiological response supporting survival during food scarcity. It's not like this phenotype suddenly evolved or there was a genetic mutation in recent years. Unusual given today's energy-abundance and epidemic of overweight - yes. Unique - not so much.\\n3. Physicians should understand what the patient is trying to optimize for. It's important to note that Norwitz has off-the-charts levels of LDLC and Apo B (they can't even measure the latter, it's so high). He says he's not optimizing for Apo B, even understanding there could be long-term CVD risks, because he's trying to stay in remission from chronic IBD (with apparently severe flare-ups of ulcerative colitis) during the remainder of med school. Understanding the horrible time he must have had with this while finishing college and then as a PhD student in England, I still find his reasoning a bit disingenuous and truly wonder if this is the actual reason he's been so prominently pushing for more acceptance of the Keto diet on social media. First of all, he doesn't seem to be familiar with Will Bulsiewicz or any GI doc who might be able to assist him therapeutically in this matter. It sounded like he was self-treating in terms of dietary experiments. Secondly, he's quite risk averse over the long-term when it comes to the idea of lowering his Apo B via a PCSK9i since there's apparently one MR study out there linking the PCSK9 knockout to a higher incidence of dementia. So, he's willing to gamble on CVD but not on dementia? Or he truly doesn't believe he's at greater risk of CVD either? That's my question. I'm surprised Simon Hill didn't call him on this but maybe he will later on. To be fair, Norwitz does a CCTA every few years or so and is due for another one in three years. He says if there's evidence of plaque accumulation then optimizing for Apo B would make sense. Whether that's a wise approach to CVD prevention or not is another matter.\\n4. Apo B is necessary but not sufficient for plaque accumulation, but perhaps it eventually becomes sufficient depending on how high. They were speculating that Dayspring and Bill Cromwell would likely agree that there is some level at which high Apo B itself is sufficient (for instance, an FH situation). However, Norwitz still wants to test the LMHR phenotype specifically in case there's a different, more gentle slope on the road to plaque progression than FH or gen pop.\\n5. My personal favorite: Apo B vs. metabolic vulnerability (currently quantified with the MVX  metric) in non-fatal MACE vs. ACM. This solves that annoying J curve problem that shows how lower LDLC/Apo B might be associated with higher mortality incidence. When you adjust for metabolic vulnerability (an index of various metrics including malnourishment and GlycA) the J curve disappears and there's a monotonic increase with lipid levels. This is why Apo B itself is currently great at predicting incidence and risk of non-fatal MACE but not so good at predicting ACM; there's a lot of noise associated with differential levels of metabolic vulnerability. Cromwell communicated this recently in a series of talks available on youtube (one of them being his address at Co-Sci from this spring). Worth checking out. Unfortunately, while we can get GlycA itself measured (LabCorp, among others, provides this test), MVX isn't quite ready for prime time.\", 'subreddit': 'Cholesterol', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rae2', 'score': 4, 'upvotes': 5, 'num_comments': 10, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1eb9znm/nick_norwitz_on_simon_hill_oreos_keto_lmhr_lipid/', 'date': '2024-07-24', 'comments': [{'id': 'lexl73k', 'name': 't1_lexl73k', 'parent_id': 't3_1eb9znm', 'link_id': 't3_1eb9znm', 'text': 'Thanks for sharing this as I don\\'t plan on watching this thing in full.

Since joining about a week ago, I have scoured posts about low saturated fat diets, Peter Attia (sp?), Lilly clinical trials, etc. I spoke with my doctor about the following questions and was met with a very haulted response in that I don\\'t pose a threat right now. Basically, the phone conversation I had with her left me with feeling like I\\'m overreacting because I am only 37 and not \"currently\" at risk. I mentioned to her that I have a young child and my mother died young (64,  pancreatic cancer) and I am trying to be as proactive (as Kaiser markets themselves and prides themselves as being) as possible. She couldn\\'t get off the phone with me fast enough and was pretty combative with my research based responses, basically saying it without saying it that she was the doctor and this is what they know now. Any advice on the following (doctor\\'s response in parenthesis) is greatly appreciated. Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.\\n\\n  \\nStats: 37 year old female, 5\\'2\", 158 lbs, Teacher (active, but not ACTIVE)\\n\\nHere goes:\\n\\n  \\n1. Based on my most recent blood test, my cholesterol went from in September 154 to 191 (normal value is <199), my triglycerides went from 76 to 87 (normal value is <149), my HDL went from 48 to 58 (normal value is > 40), my LDL went from 91 to 117 (normal value is <99), my Cholesterol/High Density Lipoprotein went from 3.3 to 3.2 (normal value is <3.9; so relatively the same), and my cholesterol (non-HDL) went from 106 to 133 (nonHDL targets are 30 mg higher than LDL targets; what does that mean)? Can you determine what happened?\\xa0(She didn\\'t seem to be concerned with this \"spike\" and didn\\'t know what caused it. Thoughts on the above numbers? I did have my thyroid tested test came back normal, so no caused for concern about hypothyroidism)\\n\\n2. I have been pretty diligent with my 10 mg statin and have been religious with my statin since my lipid panel on 6/22. Would you recommend upping my statin or just retesting in a few months? Are there negative reasons for raising a statin? (She doesn\\'t want to raise my statin at this time, because there can be negative risk factors with upping a statin. She said that 10mg is the \"highest\" for low to moderate risk patients, and because there is no family risk, she wanted to stay put at 10mg).\\n\\n3. I am interested in possibly taking Ezetimibe with my statin as combination therapy or a PCSK9 inhibitor like Repatha. Do you recommend any low dose aspirin? (She ordered a lipid panel for October, three months from now, and said she would prescribe me Zetia if I wanted to move forward with that at that time; Thoughts?)\\n\\n4. When is the best time to take my statin\\xa0for maximum absorption? (She mentioned that since I take Crestor, taking it right before bed is best. She said that taking it with a CoQ10 doesn\\'t mess up absorption, but that I should take CoQ10 before a meal and then my statin before bed and I will be fine).\\n\\n5. I am very concerned with my Lipoprotein A results. I know that the normal value is <75 and I was shocked to see that my value is 301. From what I understand, this is a result of genetic high cholesterol and from what I understand, there is currently no medication to lower lipoprotein a levels, but that you need to maintain a low LDL and basically take care of everything else to minimize your risk of strokes, heart attacks, etc. (This is where she got pretty combatative with me and frustrated and explained that is why this test is not normally done because the information just basically becomes an FYI witht much to do with it. I explained to her that I\\'m an information person and basically having a baseline is helpful to me so that I can do everything in my power to control other factors, since I can\\'t do much about this number. She agreed and said that there are many things in the works right now in terms of how to treat LPa (like what is going on with Lilly and that they just don\\'t know how to move forward right now). This is where she got pretty combatative with information and \"being in the know\" such as a doctor and that she realizes that this information isn\\'t readily available to people outside of the medical field, so she forwarded me this information in regards to LPa levels:\\n\\n  \\nThere is limited evidence indicating that Lp(a) lowering reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk (see \\'Disease associations\\' above). Thus, except in very rare cases, we do not target Lp(a) with any therapy known to lower Lp(a). (See \\'Next steps\\' below.)\\xa0Initial approach — Our initial approach to reducing ASCVD risk in patients with elevated Lp(a) is to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to its target. (See \"Management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease\" and \"Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease\".)\\xa0Usually this involves treatment with a statin, with or without ezetimibe. Statins increase Lp(a) levels \\\\[58\\\\]. However, the impact of this increase on cardiovascular events is not known and is felt to be small \\\\[42,59\\\\]. Ezetimibe does not lower Lp(a).\\xa0Some patients who cannot achieve an optimal LDL-C with statin plus ezetimibe are treated with a PCSK9 inhibitor. In the FOURIER trial, Lp(a) reduction observed with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy was associated with ASCVD risk reduction independent of LDL-C lowering, as discussed below \\\\[41\\\\]. Thus, very high-risk patients with high Lp(a) levels may benefit disproportionately from a lipid-lowering strategy that includes a PCSK9 inhibitor. In a post-hoc analysis of ODYSSEY outcomes, participants with LDL-C levels between 55 mg/dL and <70 mg/dL with a Lp(a) level above the median of 13.6 mg/dL had fewer cardiovascular disease events on treatment with alirocumab \\\\[60\\\\].\\xa0Next steps — For patients with elevated Lp(a) who have reached their LDL-C target or who have received all recommended therapies to lower LDL-C, we await definitive evidence from ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials with selective Lp(a)-lowering therapies and do not have any broader recommendations on Lp(a) lowering.\\xa0The use of these therapies in this setting has not been proven in prospectively designed clinical outcome trials. In addition, there are costs to these therapies.\\n\\n6. Do statins raise lipoprotein a levels?\\xa0(She said she didn\\'t know; that there are mixed results in this, but basically I am not a candidate who truly \"can\\'t\" take a statin, so the benefits outweight the costs)\\n\\n7. My goal is to get my LDL below 40 (need to go down 77 points) and keep my HDL above 45. I would like to test my ApoB (that should be in the 40s). How long would it take to get my LDL down to 40-what extreme measures do I need to do?\\xa0(She said that it\\'s possible to get my LDL down as close to 40, but that it is really hard to do and would account for a \"pretty miserable life\" and that she \"wasn\\'t sure how I would feel with an LDL that low\" since our body needs some cholesterol to function. She said that testing for ApoB is mute at this point (in the similar vein to testing for LPa) since it\\'s just FYI information and then what do I do with it if the range is out of normal, when the only current response is to treat with a statin, which I\\'m doing. She said that the \"extreme measure\" I could do at this time is to become plant based with my diet)\\n\\n8. I would like to meet with a cardiologist, and a lipidologist and endocrinologist, if possible. (She didn\\'t respond to the need to meet with a lipidologist or endocrinologist (I\\'m not sure if this is possible through Kaiser), but did put in a referral for a cardiologist, with obvious hesitation, as she thinks the referral will get bounced back. I mentioned that aren\\'t a risk patient due to my numbers, and was met with a similar response that because my risk is currently low, with an assumption that cardiologists are dealing with more severe cases and there isn\\'t much availability. She put in the referral and said that if it gets bounced back, that I would have to go through member services and make an appointment on my own, if it is okayed. \\\\*\\\\*This is where my major frustration is coming from. I don\\'t feel like my situation should be diluted solely based on the severity of what other people are going through. This is apples and oranges and I am trying to be proactive. I wil absolutely be following up with the cardiologist referral and next steps.\"\"\\n\\n9. I would like to schedule a CAC, an APoB test, and an APoA test. Would you recommend that I have a CIMT (carotid intima-media thickness) or angiogram to see my plaque levels? I know it may show 0, but wouldn\\'t it be smart to have a baseline? (She said that the CAC is a test she can\\'t put a referral in for, but that the cardiologist would have to do that. She seemed to skate over ordering the APoB and APoa test, but I am sure her response will be that it is just \"more information\" that I just can do nothing about. I plan on asking my hopefully referred cardiologists about all of these tests)\\n\\n10. Should I be paying attention to Hs-CRP (inflammation), LP-PLA2 (enzyme to measure plaque activity), hba1c (blood sugar)?\\xa0(I didn\\'t ask her this question, but was wondering if any of you have any insight on monitoring any of these?)\\n\\n11. I\\'ve also heard that Niacin and/or CoQ10 can be helpful in lowering LDL (and possibly lipoprotein a). I\\'ve started taking 100 mgs of Coq10 and 3 tsps daily of Metamucil as a soluble fiber, since I know both of these things can help with lowering LDL. Should I continue CoQ10 & Metamucil? Would you also recommend taking Niacin and/or Fish Oil or any omegas? Keep with Metamucil or straight psyllium husk? Can psyllium husk affect the absorption of my statins? (She said that taking Niacin with me already being on a statin is not necessary nor recommended, due to the risks that niacin can cause. She said takign CoQ10 is smart since LDL can mess with the CoQ10 levels in our body and taking it as a supplement helps with that. She didn\\'t speak it to possibly lowering my LPa, though. She said taking Metamucil is great and that upping fiber in my diet is really smart. She said that Fish Oil has been pretty controversial and that it is actually showing some signs of being harmful (or not helpful) for people in my situation. She said that Metamucil of straight psyllium husk is fine and that psyllium husk does not affect the absoption of my statins)\\n\\n12. I\\'ve also read that a plant based diet is basically smart for someone in my situation. Would you recommend that I become a vegetarian, as well as avoiding cheese and eggs? Or just a low-carb diet? Should I be avoiding alcohol entirely? What is the recommended % of saturated fats that I should be staying under daily-less than 10mg?? Effects of coffee? Should I be intermittent fasting? I know that diet and exercise won\\'t affect the lipoprotein a, but it seems like I might need an extreme lifestyle change to really get my bad cholesterol levels as low as possible to help combat the lipoprotein a levels I can\\'t do much about. (She confirmed that if my goal is lower my rish of cardiovascular disease as much as possible, that switching to a plant-based diet and avoiding as much animal biproducts as possible is a must. She recommended avoiding cheed and eggs, but didn\\'t mention anything about going low carb. In terms of alcohol, she laughed in the fact that, \"Samantha! You\\'re 37 years old! You can have a drink  two a party and not worry about it!\" basically contributing to the notion that she \"said it without saying it\" that I am overreacting, and I really do not feel like I am. She confirmed that getting daily saturated fats down to 10mg a day is ideal, but really hard to do and that the best way to keep it as low as possible is with going plant based. She said that coffee is good for you and that it\\'s what we put in coffee that messes things up. I told her I have my coffee with stevia drops and oatmilk and she said that is fine. She said that intermittent fasting is controversial and that she would not recommend.)\\n\\n13. Are there any clinical trials available for people with my similar results? (She said that she is sure there are clinical trials but that she was unaware of them and it isn\\'t her wheelhouse or recommendation).\\n\\n  \\nWHEW! So, that is a summary sentence of the phone conversation. I am left with an action plan of: 1) another lipid panel in October 2024 2) keeping my statin at 10mg 3) going plant based in my diet 4) put in a refferal for a cardiologist. I feel like \"switching doctors\" within Kaiser will just provide me with another doctor in the network with the same response. Any other suggestions for me at this time?\\n\\nI\\'ve also been taking down some notes with the beneficial information from this feed.

You may not need to get your LDLC/Apo B that low and you are best off following sensible prevention strategies in terms of diet and lifestyle so that you don't have to go too aggressive on the medications. Plant-based is certainly an option should you want to pursue that because it eliminates any dietary cholesterol (in case you are an over-absorber), it minimizes sat fat as long as you aren't consuming coconut or palm oil, and it's very high in fiber. If you do go that route make sure to take a B12. BTW you can always order testing independently via [ownyourlabs.com](http://ownyourlabs.com) which uses LabCorp. (Update: or Precision Health Reports mentioned below). \\n\\n8. It's understandable you want to meet with these specialists but they are likely not going to be able to give you more insight than you've been able to gather already (and in about 1/100th of the amount of time as well so congrats there!). What is your A1C currently? Do you have T2D in the family? One thing you might do if you suspect fatty liver is request a liver US of your PCP which should be a no-brainer to order. Get a CAC scan too, while you are at it - 37 with high Lp(a) isn't too young for that. Another test you'll want to do over the next year or so is a carotid US esp. if the CAC comes back with a 0 score. \\n\\n9. Ah ok - yes you should go to the cardiologist for the CAC and carotid US too I guess. Or a CIMT if Kaiser has access to one. The other test that should be on your radar going forward is the ankle-brachia index. All three: CAC, CUS, and ABI are recommended by Dr. Bill Cromwell who is a top lipidologist and clinical researcher with a youtube presence via interview. He's also medical director at Precision Health Reports and they do a comprehensive cardiometabolic assessment for $249. I found them very useful as a supplement to the usual care I get from my own health system (not Kaiser but it also has its limits . . . ). Check them out if you want: [Precisionhealthreports.com](http://Precisionhealthreports.com)\\n\\n10. Yes. One advantage of the precision health reports resource is that they measure LP-IR and GlycA. I found both to be very helpful. Now you can order these via ownyourlabs too if you want. Both Precision and Ownyourlabs use LabCorp for the bloodwork. But Precision Health Reports has a wonderful user-friendly format where all the detailed testing is explained to me. Costs about an extra $100 for that but hey, I found it worth it. Precision Health reports also will test either Apo B or do the LDL particle count itself. I just did Apo B as it's basically just one number with the same info conveyed as a more complicated LDL particle count result.\\n\\n11. Dont' take Niacin. It's not been clinically shown to improve outcomes with high Lp(a) and the side effects including flushing, possible high LFT's and other stuff can be a problem. Psyllium husk is great, CoQ10 hasn't really been shown to be effective but many swear by it. Use it if you need to for muscle pain but other than that it might not be necessary.\\n\\n12. Best not to go LC. You are better off doing plant-based (IMO but that's backed by the research). The problem with LC is that it's usually accompanied by high fat (as in LC/HF or Keto). Keto can spike your LDLC/Apo B. Plant based will lower it. See Dr. Michael Greger's books or his website [Nutritionfacts.org](http://Nutritionfacts.org) if you need more info on going plant-based. As for alcohol, the latest research - in AHA's journal *Hypertension* -  is that even one drink per day can raise BP over the long term. I've had this discussion with my providers as well and some of them think I'm nuts lol. The reality is that there's simply no safe level of ethanol. Now, can one drink a week be harmful? Probably not. But every alcoholic beverage is a missed opportunity to drink something more healthy such as a cup of green tea. Your provider's advice re: coffee is accurate based on the research I've seen.\\n\\nWant to pause here for a minute: IMO you  have a decent PCP! She's obviously spending a lot of time answering your questions even if you both don't quite see eye-to-eye. \\n\\n13.  Interestingly, there were just published some results from the MESA trial re: aspirin use for those with high Lp(a) that suggested aspirin (probably low dose but not sure) can lower MACE 30-40%. Worth checking out. Don't have the link to the paper but Tom Dayspring mentioned it during an Lp(a) interview on Simon Hill's The Proof podcast. About one hour 37 min. in. I'd recommend listening to the entire ep. Also listen to Attia's interview of Benoit Arsenault (The Drive, probably in 2022?) as he is a top-notch Lp(a) researcher in Canada. Both these interviews will go into the weeds w/r/t that Lp(a) is exactly. I've spent the last few years listening and reading and am only beginning to understand it all myself. There's also a youtube with an expert panel from I think NYU on Lp(a) you can search for. They do an amazing job too. If I can re-find that I'll link here later on.\\n\\nRe: your dietary and lifestyle plan, you can consider Nu Salt or similar salt substitute, especially if you feel you are at risk of hypertension (or have been diagnosed). I use this due to family history with salt-sensitive hypertension. It's a nice hack. If you don't like the taste of potassium chloride you can always go 50/50 or 75/25 with the sodium and I believe there are brands that sell those combinations.\\n\\nBest of luck to you!\", 'author': 'meh312059', 'score': 6, 'date': '2024-07-07', 'replies': [{'id': 'lc3xavh', 'name': 't1_lc3xavh', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'Great post btw', 'author': 'Henry-2k', 'score': 3, 'date': '2024-07-07'}, {'id': 'lc43166', 'name': 't1_lc43166', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'I\\'d like to try the plant based diet (thank you for the Dr. Michale Greger book link!) prior to upping the statin and/or adding Zetia as combination therapy.

You may not need to get your LDLC/Apo B that low and you are best off following sensible prevention strategies in terms of diet and lifestyle so that you don't have to go too aggressive on the medications. Plant-based is certainly an option should you want to pursue that because it eliminates any dietary cholesterol (in case you are an over-absorber), it minimizes sat fat as long as you aren't consuming coconut or palm oil, and it's very high in fiber. If you do go that route make sure to take a B12. BTW you can always order testing independently via [ownyourlabs.com](http://ownyourlabs.com) which uses LabCorp. (Update: or Precision Health Reports mentioned below). \\n\\n8. It's understandable you want to meet with these specialists but they are likely not going to be able to give you more insight than you've been able to gather already (and in about 1/100th of the amount of time as well so congrats there!). What is your A1C currently? Do you have T2D in the family? One thing you might do if you suspect fatty liver is request a liver US of your PCP which should be a no-brainer to order. Get a CAC scan too, while you are at it - 37 with high Lp(a) isn't too young for that. Another test you'll want to do over the next year or so is a carotid US esp. if the CAC comes back with a 0 score. \\n\\n9. Ah ok - yes you should go to the cardiologist for the CAC and carotid US too I guess. Or a CIMT if Kaiser has access to one. The other test that should be on your radar going forward is the ankle-brachia index. All three: CAC, CUS, and ABI are recommended by Dr. Bill Cromwell who is a top lipidologist and clinical researcher with a youtube presence via interview. He's also medical director at Precision Health Reports and they do a comprehensive cardiometabolic assessment for $249. I found them very useful as a supplement to the usual care I get from my own health system (not Kaiser but it also has its limits . . . ). Check them out if you want: [Precisionhealthreports.com](http://Precisionhealthreports.com)\\n\\n10. Yes. One advantage of the precision health reports resource is that they measure LP-IR and GlycA. I found both to be very helpful. Now you can order these via ownyourlabs too if you want. Both Precision and Ownyourlabs use LabCorp for the bloodwork. But Precision Health Reports has a wonderful user-friendly format where all the detailed testing is explained to me. Costs about an extra $100 for that but hey, I found it worth it. Precision Health reports also will test either Apo B or do the LDL particle count itself. I just did Apo B as it's basically just one number with the same info conveyed as a more complicated LDL particle count result.\\n\\n11. Dont' take Niacin. It's not been clinically shown to improve outcomes with high Lp(a) and the side effects including flushing, possible high LFT's and other stuff can be a problem. Psyllium husk is great, CoQ10 hasn't really been shown to be effective but many swear by it. Use it if you need to for muscle pain but other than that it might not be necessary.\\n\\n12. Best not to go LC. You are better off doing plant-based (IMO but that's backed by the research). The problem with LC is that it's usually accompanied by high fat (as in LC/HF or Keto). Keto can spike your LDLC/Apo B. Plant based will lower it. See Dr. Michael Greger's books or his website [Nutritionfacts.org](http://Nutritionfacts.org) if you need more info on going plant-based. As for alcohol, the latest research - in AHA's journal *Hypertension* -  is that even one drink per day can raise BP over the long term. I've had this discussion with my providers as well and some of them think I'm nuts lol. The reality is that there's simply no safe level of ethanol. Now, can one drink a week be harmful? Probably not. But every alcoholic beverage is a missed opportunity to drink something more healthy such as a cup of green tea. Your provider's advice re: coffee is accurate based on the research I've seen.\\n\\nWant to pause here for a minute: IMO you  have a decent PCP! She's obviously spending a lot of time answering your questions even if you both don't quite see eye-to-eye. \\n\\n13.  Interestingly, there were just published some results from the MESA trial re: aspirin use for those with high Lp(a) that suggested aspirin (probably low dose but not sure) can lower MACE 30-40%. Worth checking out. Don't have the link to the paper but Tom Dayspring mentioned it during an Lp(a) interview on Simon Hill's The Proof podcast. About one hour 37 min. in. I'd recommend listening to the entire ep. Also listen to Attia's interview of Benoit Arsenault (The Drive, probably in 2022?) as he is a top-notch Lp(a) researcher in Canada. Both these interviews will go into the weeds w/r/t that Lp(a) is exactly. I've spent the last few years listening and reading and am only beginning to understand it all myself. There's also a youtube with an expert panel from I think NYU on Lp(a) you can search for. They do an amazing job too. If I can re-find that I'll link here later on.\\n\\nRe: your dietary and lifestyle plan, you can consider Nu Salt or similar salt substitute, especially if you feel you are at risk of hypertension (or have been diagnosed). I use this due to family history with salt-sensitive hypertension. It's a nice hack. If you don't like the taste of potassium chloride you can always go 50/50 or 75/25 with the sodium and I believe there are brands that sell those combinations.\\n\\nBest of luck to you!\", 'author': 'meh312059', 'score': 6, 'date': '2024-07-07', 'replies': [{'id': 'lc3xavh', 'name': 't1_lc3xavh', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'Great post btw', 'author': 'Henry-2k', 'score': 3, 'date': '2024-07-07'}, {'id': 'lc43166', 'name': 't1_lc43166', 'parent_id': 't1_lc31yfq', 'link_id': 't3_1dxn5hy', 'text': 'I\\'d like to try the plant based diet (thank you for the Dr. Michale Greger book link!) prior to upping the statin and/or adding Zetia as combination therapy.

Standard lipid panels don\\'t measure lipoprotein concentration, only the cholesterol content. NonHDLC consists of all cholesterol from LDL\\'s, VLDL\\'s, IDL\\'s, etc. Obviously LDL\\'s make up the majority as they have the longest residence time.\\n\\n2&3. Given the high Lp(a) - btw is that in nmol/L or mg/dl? - your LDLC/Apo B target should be under 70 mg/dl so you should consider upping your statin to a higher intensity (perhaps 20 mg. Crestor) and/or adding Zetia if your provider is willing to do it. You should also make sure you are minimizing sat fat intake and upping fiber in your diet to keep your LDLC/Apo B as naturally low as possible.\\n\\n4. Morning or evening is fine for Crestor.\\n\\n5.

So Nexlizet/Nexlitol may be a better option if pre-diabetic or diabetic. Also the label now indicates Nexlizet/Nexlitol can be used for cardiovascular risk reduction (i.e., lowers risk of cardio events). Docs can now (as of a month ago or so) prescribe Nexlizet/Nexlitol instead of or with statins. The statin can be replaced altogether by Nexlizet/Nexlitol or the statin dose can be lowered if Nexlitol/Nexlizet is prescribed as an adjunct. Consult your physician. Here is more info:\\n\\nhttps://www.nexlizet.com/\\n\\nRead up on it. The drug should be covered by payors. Think there is a way to still get it if insurance is not yet on board. However, payor coverage is rapidly increasing because Nexlizet/Nexlitol can now be prescribed for primary prevention. Docs will still probably try to prescribe statins but this sounds like a good way not to have to take statins due to all their bad side effects or reduce the amount of statins.

I went on and off statins for the next 8 years (lots of muscle pain and gastro issues on three different ones), got retested, and had a second CAC of 334 (LDL of 160 off statins at that point). My cardiologist suggested Praluent - got me down to 54 LDL with no side effects. Got switched to Repatha by insurance and my latest LDL is 48! Eating pretty well, keeping saturated fat below 10g, one serving of red meat a month, a lot of fish and a little chicken, very little low fat dairy. \\n\\nI can finally not stress about my lipids - I'm at a good level considering my family history and high CAC score and I can eat a diet that doesn't stress me out either. \\n\\nI strongly recommend trying pcsk9 inhibitors if you have high CAC numbers and either can't take statins or need something more to get your ldl/non hdll C to target- it takes a load off your mind. \", 'subreddit': 'Cholesterol', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rae2', 'score': 23, 'upvotes': 23, 'num_comments': 28, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1bddceo/repatha_kicking_ass/', 'date': '2024-03-12', 'comments': [{'id': 'kum9brl', 'name': 't1_kum9brl', 'parent_id': 't3_1bddceo', 'link_id': 't3_1bddceo', 'text': 'Got my LDL down to 52 at my test last month.

The major classes of commonly prescribed lipid-lowering agents, particularly statins, clearly increase circulating PCSK9 levels and which likely diminishes the effect of these drugs on the reduction of LDL-C concentrations. Thus, PCSK9 inhibitors, particularly monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9, in combination with statins, are one of the most promising and effective approaches to achieving very low LDL-C levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular events\", 'subreddit': 'Cholesterol', 'subreddit_id': 't5_2rae2', 'score': 6, 'upvotes': 6, 'num_comments': 0, 'url': 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Cholesterol/comments/1b8rns3/pcsk9_statins_and_repatha_research/', 'date': '2024-03-07', 'comments': []}]\n"
